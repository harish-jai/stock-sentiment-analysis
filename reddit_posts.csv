1iwft77,1740332813.0,"Warren Buffett sounds warning to Washington as Berkshire reports record profit, cash","https://www.reuters.com/business/warren-buffett-says-us-should-spend-wisely-plans-increase-investment-japan-2025-02-22/?utm_source=reddit.com

NEW YORK, Feb 22 (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab on Saturday reported record annual profits and boosting its cash stake to $334.2 billion, as Warren Buffett used his annual shareholder letter to caution Washington to spend money wisely and take care of those who get the ""short straws in life.""

Buffett's admonition came as many investors worry U.S. lawmakers won't rein in soaring fiscal deficits, and could make them worse by extending tax cuts backed by President Donald Trump.

The 94-year-old Buffett, the world's sixth-richest person and arguably its most famous investor, also acknowledged his advanced age, telling shareholders he uses a cane and will spend less time fielding their questions at Berkshire's annual meeting on May 3.

He nonetheless assured shareholders they would be in good hands after he turns over the conglomerate's reins to Vice Chairman Greg Abel, saying the 62-year-old Abel has ""vividly shown his ability"" to deploy capital.

""It won't be long"" before Abel takes over, Buffett said.

Buffett's letter was accompanied by Berkshire's annual report, where it reported a third straight record annual operating profit, rising 27% to $47.44 billion.

Quarterly operating profit rose 71% to $14.53 billion, also a record, and which analysts viewed as solid.

Net income for the full year totaled $89 billion, including gains from Berkshire's common stock investments such as Apple (AAPL.O), opens new tab and American Express (AXP.N), opens new tab.

Berkshire's cash stake reflected high business valuations and nine straight quarters of selling more stocks than it bought. The selling included Apple, which remained its largest stock investment.

""Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities,"" Buffett wrote.

'FISCAL FOLLY'

This year is Buffett's 60th at the helm of Berkshire, which he transformed from a failing textile company into a $1.03 trillion conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy, industrial, retail and other sectors.

""Berkshire's activities now impact all corners of our country. And we are not finished,"" Buffett said.

Buffett said Berkshire will continue preferring equities, primarily U.S. stocks, over cash, even as it resists paying a dividend to shareholders, which it has not done since 1967.

He said reinvesting in Berkshire is one reason the Omaha, Nebraska-based company paid $26.8 billion of federal taxes last year, 5% of all payments by corporate America. Buffett himself is worth $149.5 billion, Forbes magazine said,
But he also sent a cautionary message to Washington, lamenting how capitalism ""has its faults and abuses--in certain respects more egregious now than ever,"" with malfeasance by ""scoundrels and promoters"" in full force.

He urged lawmakers to help preserve a stable U.S. dollar, saying ""fiscal folly"" can destroy the value of paper money and the country has at times ""come close to the edge.""

Buffett said long-term success of Berkshire and the American economy, which he called the ""American miracle,"" has depended on people's ability to participate.

That, he said, is something Uncle Sam can encourage, or take away.

""Take care of the many who, for no fault of their own, get the short straws in life. They deserve better,"" Buffett wrote, addressing the government.
""And never forget that we need you to maintain a stable currency and that result requires both wisdom and vigilance on your part,"" he added.

Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who rates Berkshire ""hold,"" said: ""Talking about the business of America being messy was his way of addressing the political landscape and its impact on the macroeconomic environment. He is warning Washington: Be careful where you tread.""

FEWER BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

While Berkshire has not made a major purchase of an entire company since 2016, Buffett said it is likely to increase its combined $23.5 billion of investments in five Japanese trading houses: Itochu (8001.T), opens new tab, Marubeni (8002.T), opens new tab, Mitsubishi (8058.T), opens new tab, Mitsui (8031.T), opens new tab and Sumitomo (8053.T), opens new tab.

Other stocks appear pricey, with the Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX), opens new tab hitting a new high on Wednesday and the Nasdaq (.IXIC), opens new tab just 3% below its December 16 peak.

Berkshire's size also inhibits its shares from trouncing the indexes, as they did decades ago.
The company's stock price has risen 15% in the last year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 rose 18%.

Over the last decade, Berkshire's stock price has risen 225%, while the index rose 241% including dividends and 185% excluding dividends, Reuters data show.

""They will have lots of buying opportunities but Berkshire will never be the large double-digit compounder it had been,"" said Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Capital Management in Phoenix.

At Berkshire's annual meeting, Buffett will spend less time on the stage in a downtown Omaha arena where he, Abel and Vice Chairman Ajit Jain will answer shareholder questions.

Tens of thousands of people attend the meeting and a weekend of shareholder events, including shopping.

Buffett told Fortune magazine last month that he was still having fun and able to do a few things reasonably well, while other activities had been ""eliminated or greatly minimized.""

The meeting will also not feature the traditional movie created by Buffett's daughter Susie.
In discussing his age, Buffett said he talks regularly on Sundays with his 91-year-old sister Bertie, using an old-fashioned phone.

""We cover the joys of old age and discuss such exciting topics as the relative merits of our canes,"" he said. ""In my case, the utility is limited to the avoidance of falling flat on my face.""

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

1irmza9,1739807605.0,Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple's Earnings,"**Foreign Exchange Impacts on Apple**

The US dollar (USDXY) can have a huge impact on Apple’s revenue and earnings as around 50% of Apple’s sales occur internationally. Much of the past ten years the USDXY has hovered in the 92-98 range. When COVID-19 hit in March 2020, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate and the USDXY hovered in the 89-95 range for a majority of the second half of 2021 through early 2022. In early 2022 the Federal reserve started to hike the federal funds rate and did so through the end of 2023. From mid-2022 through today the USDXY has hovered in the 103-113 range. This is is a 10-25% difference. The elevated USDXY poses significant revenue headwinds for Apple as it costs Apple much more to convert back to US dollars on foreign revenue and it also can lead to lower sales volume as Apple has to raise prices in foreign countries to help offset a strong USDXY. A strong USDXY can help Apple when it comes to foreign investment and international expenses, but the revenue and sales impact outweighs any gains in the cost area. Tim Cook cites in Apple’s Q1 2023 earnings call that foreign exchange (FX) impacts had a “nearly 800 basis point impact,” on revenue. In Apple’s latest Q1 2025 earnings call Tim Cook stated that FX would have a negative 2.5% impact on revenue, but that is YoY not compared to 2021 meaning on a constant currency basis compared to 2021 it would be close to the 6-8% range. Below is a five-year chart of the USDXY. Let’s take a look at Apple’s fiscal year 2024 performance with a 6% constant currency adjustment to revenue to compare to FY 2021 on a constant currency basis.

**FY 2024 Example**

Apple’s total net sales in FY 2024 was $391 billion. With a constant currency 6% adjustment it would be $415 billion. Apple’s total cost of sales for FY 2024 was $210 billion. If we add in a 6% negative impact for a weakened USDXY it would be $223 billion. This would mean Apple’s gross margins would have been 52.8% instead of the reported 46.2% for FY 2024. Apple’s adjusted diluted EPS for FY 2024 would have been around $7.55/share vs the reported $6.75 adjusting for the one-tax payment made in Q4 2024. Here is the math:

Revenue: $415 billion

Cost of Sales: $223 billion

Operation Expenses: $57.5 billion

Effective Tax Rate: 15.8%

Total Outstanding Shares: \~15 billion

($415 -$223)=gross margin -($57.5) = operating income \*(15.8%)= ($113.25)/15=$7.55

As you can see, FY 2024 EPS would have been 12% higher on a constant currency basis compared to FY 2021. Gross margin would have been 660 basis points higher. The strong USDXY has a significant impact on Apple’s earnings. I think the second half of FY 2025 FY 2026 could be a big growth year for Apple on paper if the USDXY weakens and Apple’s hardware replacement cycle follows its normal 3–4-year cycle. The last big upgrade cycle took place during the end of 2020-2021.

I think portfolios would be better served looking at diversification on the basis of revenue and cash flow similarities compared to trading similarities.

My thought process is as follows (again, only considering non-dividend stocks): 

The only thing moving the needle is speculation. If AAPL made 1bil more than expected, the stock doesn’t move until the information is available and people start speciation whether it’s good to buy/sell this information. 

Since all the money is just a pooled from the traders, it’s zero sum? It’s not a zero sum wager (winning from another’s loss) but it certainly sounds like zero sum 

Say a stock has 10 investors each having $100 invested. The moment 1/2 of them cash out, the other 1/2 would be left with $50 each, cuz money got taken from the pool and no new money came in

A top Apple (AAPL) stock analyst says the consumer electronics giant is mulling whether to make a humanoid robot.

In a post on social network X on Wednesday, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple is exploring both humanoid and nonhumanoid robots as part of its future smart-home ecosystem.

""These products are still in the early proof-of-concept (POC) stage internally,"" Kuo said. ""Given current progress and typical development cycles, Apple's robot mass production likely won't start until 2028 or later.""

""Interestingly, Apple has been unusually open about sharing some of its robotics research during the early POC stage — possibly to attract talent,"" he added.

Kuo cautioned that Apple is still very early in the product development cycle. The proof-of-concept stage is a ""testing ground"" used to determine whether core technologies and product ideas are viable before proceeding.

Apple's rumored foldable iPhone is also in the proof-of-concept stage, he said.

""However, many projects never progress beyond POC — the Apple Car is probably the most notable example of a project that got stuck at this stage,"" Kuo said.",30,36,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inyfc8/apple_interested_in_making_humanoid_robot_top/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I'm looking for some advice and guidance on next steps.  Right now I'm on a Joint Tennant with a parent, that I need to get out of. My options seem to be, remove them with their permission from the account. Open an individual and transfer the money or a Roth IRA. My income, 29m is between 100-150k a year and I have a about 10k invested atm.

If I transfer the money to a Roth do I instantly hit the maximum? Is it worth it with my income, plus potential raises over the next 10+ years? 

I am also looking to consolidate my holdings for easier monthly purchases. My thoughts are to sell QQQM and NVDA to consolidate into VOO. However VOO is a bit hard to buy monthly due to price and how much I plan to put in, right now I'm averaging $200-500 deposits a month.

My holdings are AAPL, COST, DIS, GME, INTC, NVDA, RIVN, TSM, WM, AVUV, QQQM, SCHD, and VOO. I am leaning into ETFs and want to focus growth and divetends. If I up my monthly investments as I make more and become more financially stable I hope to get essiantls paid for by diventends sooner rather than later. I've also been looking into MSTY and JEPI...

Nasdaq and Trading Economics reports 1.64, while Yahoo Finance and my personal calculations get 0.97. 

To get 0.97, I subtract the 10-K annual earnings from the sum of quarters 1-3. Then I divide by the weighted average of the diluted shares outstanding reported in the 10-K.

Does anyone know what could cause this discrepancy? Perhaps 1.64 is using non-gaap earnings? Or a different time period considered for earnings?

1iej3mb,1738341960.0,"AAPL - 26,527.62% return over 25 years","Today to the day is the anniversary of twenty five years of my first purchase of AAPL shares.  I bought 1200 dollars worth.

In early 2000, I had just graduated college.  I had a few thousand given to me as an inheritance that was being managed by a broker.

 I asked the broker about purchasing some Apple shares, and he was unimpressed, and unmoved. I was annoyed at him. Apple was the one I had the strongest impulse to purchase.

 Why apple? I had gone from being skeptical of Apple. My  college was very heavily Mac, but I had PCs.  I was unimpressed at the OS, but I was struck by people’s reactions to Jobs.  He was enthusiastic, and I liked the cut of the jib who liked the cut of his jib. I was drawn to the elitism of the people to the brand, and felt it could bounce back. This was even before iPods, mind you, before OS X.  

These were the days of the dotcom boom. This broker was taking like 500 bucks for every trade. This felt unfair, in light of the great digital democratization that was in progress, I wanted the power.  And E*trade was relatively new and it seemed legit.  I hadn’t done anything like this before, I was just a kid, really, but I decided to just go for it. 

I sold most of the shares I inherited, and threw 1200 bucks into Apple.  `(also a few other, less impressive stocks)' I did marvelously the first few months as the market soared, as did most people. 

And…. it  came tumbling down in April 2000.  Disillusioned, I decided not to try to reposition my shares, and I just let things ride for a few months.  When I rebalanced by portfolio, I kept my apple shares, which had split, despite the pull-back.

Every year, I would consider would I buy more apple now?  And it didn't occurr me to sell. Apple often seemed almost comically undervalued, and I held on or increased my investment in it.

Every time apple goes up 1 point, I get more than my initial investment back. Why? Splits.

•	2-for-1 split in 2000  
•	2-for-1 split in 2005  
•	7-for-1 split in 2014  
•	4-for-1 split in 2020

Nowadays cost basis: .88 cents.     As of today that investment has grown 26,527.62%. I added more and more apple across the years, and had some other lucky calls (my second largest holding is NVDA) but no move matches that whimsical lucky move of 25 years ago today.

The security that owning these securities has offered me is significant.  It has let me have a job that isn’t that well-payed and support my family with emergencies being take of by extra funds. We own a lot of apple products, because with the dividends, it sort of just pays for them.

I do think it’s good to give early adults access to a few thousand dollars to play the market and plan to do that with my own children.  Although I didn’t sell my shares, what I did do is convert a bunch of them to a donor advised fund (avoiding taxes, whee), and I give to charity from that for annual giving, and that feels like a win win win proposition.  

I do feel overexposed in AAPL and NVDA, but due to still hopefully having another at least 25 years to go in my life is that pullbacks eventually come back up. The biggest principle that has guided my investing is “Don’t buy crap if you can help it”, and that's my advice to new investors.",982,139,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iej3mb/aapl_2652762_return_over_25_years/

News: [Fed's Favored Inflation Gauge Posted Muted Advance In December](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-31/fed-s-favored-inflation-gauge-posted-muted-advance-in-december)

Ticker: [AAPL (Apple Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d)

Catalyst: Apple reported EPS of $2.40 vs. $2.35, and revenue of $124.3B vs 124B.

Despite these positive results, the company provided cautious guidance for the upcoming quarter, citing uncertainties related to the impact of new AI features on sales. Tim Cook mentioned that Apple Intelligence DID lead to stronger sales/growth in areas where it was rolled out (it has limited rollout right now).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Watching $250 level, no strong bias. We've seen AAPL swing close to 20% this month, (on report of sales weakness in China) but doubt this will continue.

Context: Most immediate news that comes to mind was the weakness of sales in China for the iPhone, causing the move this month.

Risks: Don't really see immediate risks beyond the trade war, in 2019/2020 this resulted in AAPL moving manufacturing/production to other countries in South East Asia- slowing growth in China has been pretty consistent, however.

Related Tickers: rest of FAANG, Samsung if you can trade overseas stocks, the various phone component manufacturers that trade with AAPL

Offhand: Apple is investing in its own high-speed network infrastructure to enhance content delivery, (just like META's undersea pipeline)

Ticker: [ACMR (ACM Research, Inc.)](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ACMR&p=d)

Catalyst: Kerrisdale Capital released a bullish report on ACM Research (ACMR), a semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment (WFE) company positioned in China but headquartered in America.

It leads China as a leading supplier of wafer cleaning tools and beneficiary of China's push toward semiconductor self-sufficiency.

Kerrisdale predicts the company to eventually compete globally and cites it as a potential 10x return. Trades at 1x 2025E revenue (likely due to China fears).

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: This is the interesting part- ACMR holds a $1.2B mkt cap but trades at a massive discount compared to its Chinese subsidiary (ACMS), which has a $5.9 billion market cap and trades at 6x 2025E revenue.

The report suggests that ACMR’s NASDAQ valuation is severely mispriced and could re-rate significantly as investors recognize the valuation gap.

Context: China/US chip war, you guys know what this is.

Sector Context: The global semiconductor industry is shifting, with China attempting to localize chip production.

Kerrisdale argues that restrictions on U.S. and Japanese WFE exports to China will only fuel ACMR’s growth as Chinese fabs increasingly turn to domestic suppliers.

China's WFE self-sufficiency has grown from 4% in 2019 to 17% in 2024 and is expected to reach 36% by 2026.

Risks: Geopolitical factors, including further U.S. export restrictions, could impact ACMR’s operations. Similar to how we have the NVDA trade restriction going on right now. However, Kerrisdale sees these restrictions as a net positive due to ACMR having less competition in China as a result. There are other players in the WFE space in China, but ACMR has a technological moat.

Ticker: [INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)

Catalyst: Intel reported revenue of $14.26B vs exp of $13.81B. Most important, the company anticipated breakeven EPS next quarter.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Somewhat rangebound for the past 3 months. Watching $20 but nothing interesting I'm watching beyond that.

Context: This earnings report is Intel's first since the departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger. Right now INTC is being led by two interim co-CEOs, and another price catalyst that could potentially happen is someone competent being picked lol. Also worth thinking of the NVDA/Deepseek/semiconductor news when reading through these catalysts.

Intel has also announced a delay in its Falcon Shores GPU and only using it internally within the company.

Risks: Intel faces significant competition from companies such as NVIDIA and AMD, the delay of their chip is pretty bad news.

Related Tickers: AMD/NVDA/TSM

Ticker: [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)

Catalyst: ASTS has received special temporary authority from the FCC to test its space-based cellular broadband network in the United States. Allows for collaboration efforts with VZ/T.

Volume/Market Cap/Technicals: Slight rise, but will watch this at open to see if volume comes in.

Context: The FCC's authorization allows ASTS to provide cell/satellite comms, allowing for greater coverage and signals that more use of ASTS satellites. I remember that the company was essentially valued based on each satellite they launched successfully in 2024, whether that hype returns remains to be seen but overall not interested in trading this unless we have retail interest again.

Sector Context: SpaceX's Starlink is also entering the direct-to-cell market, as I noted a few days ago- most of the investment that can be done in these type of cell/sat comms in public markets can really only be done in ASTS.

Risks: If SpaceX IPOs we might see a selloff in this stock simply because SpaceX is far larger/established and Elon Musk has closer ties to the government.

1idy8n6,1738272963.0,"Apple misses on iPhone revenue, sees 11% drop in China sales","Apple’s overall revenue rose by 4% in the first quarter, but it missed on Wall Street’s iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported on Thursday. 

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending Dec. 28. 

Earnings per share: $2.40 vs. $2.35 estimated 

Revenue: $124.30 billion vs. $124.12 billion estimated 

 iPhone revenue: $69.14 billion vs. $71.03 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $8.99 billion vs. $7.96 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $8.09 billion vs. $7.32 billion estimated 

Other Products revenue: $11.75 billion vs. $12.01 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $26.34 billion vs. $26.09 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.9% vs. 46.5% estimated 

 Although Apple’s overall sales rose during the quarter, the company’s closely watched iPhone sales actually declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.  

Apple’s iPhone miss versus LSEG estimates was the biggest for the company in two years, since its first-quarter earnings report in fiscal 2023. At the time, Apple said that its miss was because it was unable to make enough iPhone 14 models because of production issues in China. 

The company saw significant weakness in Greater China, which includes the mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Overall China sales declined 11.1% during the quarter to $18.51 billion. It’s the largest drop in China sales since the same quarter last year when they fell 12.9%. 

Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that iPhone sales were stronger in countries where Apple Intelligence is available. Currently, the software is only available in a handful of English-speaking countries, and it isn’t accessible in China or in Chinese. 

“During the December quarter, we saw that in markets where we had rolled out Apple intelligence, that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger than those markets where we had not rolled out Apple intelligence,” Cook said.  

Cook told CNBC that there were three factors in the company’s China performance. He said that half of the 11.1% decline was due to a change in “channel inventory,” the fact that Apple Intelligence hasn’t launched in the region and that after the quarter ended, China issued a national subsidy that would stimulate some Apple product sales.  

“If you look at the negative 11, half of the decline is due to a change in channel inventory, and so the operational performance is better,” Cook said. 

Apple executives usually give some color about how the current quarter is shaping up on a call with analysts. Wall Street is expecting guidance for the March quarter of $1.66 in earnings per share on $95.46 billion in revenue. 

The company reported $36.33 billion in net income during the quarter, up 7.1% from $33.92 billion in the same period last year. 

Apple’s iPad and Mac sales showed strong growth over last year’s struggling sales in the holiday quarter. Mac revenue rose 15% to $8.98 billion and iPad revenue grew 15% to $8.08 billion. 

The company released new Macs during the quarter, including new iMac, Mac Mini and MacBook Pro laptops in October, partially contributing to the growth. Apple also launched a new iPad Mini during the quarter. Cook attributed the growth to the new products.  

“It’s driven by the significant excitement around our latest Mac lineup,” Cook said.  

Apple’s profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Cook said that the company had over 1 billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services like Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company’s App Store system.  

The company’s “other products” category, also called Wearables, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, Beats and Vision Pro sales, declined 2% on a year-over-year basis to $11.75 billion in sales. 

Apple said it would pay a dividend of 25 cents per share and spent $30 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the first quarter.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

1icbxeu,1738097393.0,Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact By Reuters,"""Bridgewater sees short-term correction for tech stocks but bullish on DeepSeek impact""

https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bridgewater-sees-shortterm-correction-for-tech-stocks-but-bullish-on-deepseek-impact-3834767



  Hedge fund manager Bridgewater Associates said Chinese startup DeepSeek's launch of its latest artificial intelligence (AI) models could lead to a short-term correction in many tech companies' share prices but is positive for the industry.

The comments come amid a tech stocks sell-off prompted by the release of a free AI assistant launched by DeepSeek last week that the startup said uses less data at a fraction of the cost of services currently available.

DeepSeek's AI Assistant has overtaken rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application available on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the United States, raising doubts about the reasoning behind some U.S. tech companies' decision to pledge billions of dollars in AI investment.

""DeepSeek’s progress is big news, but not bad news for most of the AI ecosystem,"" Bridgewater said in a note on Monday authored by Co-Chief Investment Officer Greg Jensen and Jas Sekhon, chief scientist of AIA Labs, a division within the hedge fund focused on developing and utilizing AI and machine learning technologies to generate investment strategies and insights.

DeepSeek threatens share prices for many tech stocks in the short term, Bridgewater said.

""This may be especially true for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), because DeepSeek’s success may encourage companies to invest more in achieving efficiency gains by optimizing how AI software interacts with the hardware,"" said the note.

Shares in Nvidia, a leader in the AI chip market, fell 17% on Monday, wiping $593 billion from its market value - a record one-day loss for any company - and dragged U.S. stocks lower. That drop was partly corrected on Tuesday, with Nvidia shares up around 5% in premarket trading.

1iaoa6o,1737920856.0,S&P500 vs individual stocks,"Hi all,
Apologies for the maybe stupid question.

I have started investing about 1 year ago almost all of it (if not all) into well diversified ETFs like SXR8 and SPYY (yes, I know they overlap but I wanted to make it a little bit more USA heavy).

Now, I have really been wanting to invest into stocks and, of course, do the due diligence of learning about it. As I am still on the basics I can't help myself but ask, even long term, is SPY a better bet than, let's say, AAPL?
I understand that sometimes picking the ""good"" stock is difficult, but even 10 years ago Apple was among the companies with the highest market cap and still managed to outperform the index.

So I have 2 stupid questions based on this:
1. In your opinion, might this continue to happen in the future? Not necessarily apple but alphabet, Microsoft, nvidia or Meta are safer bets than Spy?
2. What are your recommendations on where to learn about investing into individual stocks, not say trading but more middle term (I believe it's called swing trading?)

Thanks in advance!",30,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iaoa6o/sp500_vs_individual_stocks/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1i8mzb1,1737691835.0,Switched from Ameriprise managed account to Fidelity - Sell individual stocks?,"After a year of trying an Ameriprise managed account, I recently moved everything to Fidelity to start managing it myself. They underperformed the S&P500 (before their fee), and almost all positions are just S&P500 companies anyways, so I figured if I went 100% into an S&P index on my own I can't do worse.

I'm not sure how best to proceed with the current number of individual stocks. There are 64 positions total and it's unrealistic that I'll be able to keep track of the performance/trajectory of that many companies. Buffet's ""pick a few winners"" comes to mind. I've been assuming the best thing to do is to slowly liquidate the one's I don't have a specific interest in, and buy VOO/SPY in their place.

There are many companies that I like and would like to hold on to (AAPL, AMD, AMZN, BRKB, GOOGL, JNJ, KO, MSFT, NVDA, NFLX, PG). However, the majority are S&P 500 companies that I don't follow closely (ABT, ADBE, AMAT, AMGN, AMT, AVGO, AZN, BA, BMY, CAT, COP, CRM, CVX, ... to name a few). It's not that I don't know those companies, but it feels ignorant to hold onto them knowing that I won't have time to monitor their performance.

Is there a best way to go about liquidating those and moving into an S&P 500 index? Initial temptation is gambler's fallacy (sell the low performers first and keep the better ones a bit longer).",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1i8mzb1/switched_from_ameriprise_managed_account_to/

Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear there.

I felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.

We are now on year 4, and to date I have sarcastically remarked about how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time performed against SPY and VTI.  This year I was rather surprised at the results.  All 2025 numbers use the prices right now.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1huvcpj,1736156145.0,Mag7 - Personal experiment 2024,"**Hi everyone!**

In 2024, I decided to try a simple but consistent investment experiment: I invested **€10 per week** in the ""Magnificent 7"" (MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, NVDA, TSLA, and META). The goal was to understand how regularity and patience could yield results. I confess that I rebalanced twice, but I can’t remember when exactly (oops!).

This wasn’t my only investment, and its sole purpose was to see how it would perform over the course of a year. It’s not an allocation I plan to keep in the future.

**Results**:

* I invested a total of **€520** throughout the year.
* The current portfolio value is **€706.80**, which means a profit of **€186.80** (+35.92% return).

**Key Takeaways**:

* **Consistency works:** Investing small amounts regularly helps avoid timing the market. DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) for the win!
* **Stock selection matters:** The ""Magnificent 7"" are heavily exposed to the tech sector, which had a strong year, but that also means higher volatility.
* **Patience is key:** I didn’t touch the investments throughout the year, and that was crucial for these results.

This was a personal experiment that helped me learn more about the impact of regular investing and how the market can reward those who stick to a disciplined strategy.

It’s just my experience—not right, not wrong—just mine, and I wanted to share it with you!

**Discussion**:  
Has anyone else here tried investment ""experiments"" like this? How did it go for you?

Check the screenshots for the portfolio details if you’re curious!

1hlvfap,1735108470.0,4 year returns for the graduating tech employee class of 2021,"Between August 2020 - December 2020, the big 5 tech companires -- AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, META did more interviews, hiring than their past 5 years combined. This cohort of tech employees are the ones that got the easiest interviews, and were able to uplift themselves into better companies even amongst themselves.

Interestingly, META was considered #1, AMZN and MSFT were considered tier 2 in this cohort of people.

I present to you the 4-year returns, because that's how tech world does compensation before you hit the cliff.

This means that someone who started their job on the first day of 2021 (assuming equity deposits, etc. happened the same way, they don't but just imagine), they should have gone to META and not AMZN.

Surprisingly GOOGL turned out to be the best bet in terms of volatility and performance. I can imagine META employees dumping their stock and not holding, GOOGL employees usually do auto sale, but the ones who kept it and didn't sell probably did well.

MSFT and AAPL employees also did well. Good times.",0,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1hlvfap/4_year_returns_for_the_graduating_tech_employee/

1hg7jft,1734430101.0,Rate my portfolio - turnover advice,"I'd appreciate a feedback on my current portfolio. Here are the positions with the % size.

AAPL 2.3%
QQQ 11.4%
DELL 2.8%
IONQ 56.9%
IWQU (iShares World Maxi Quality factor sector neutral) 4.6%
LVMH 3.6%
NVDA 5.7%
SMH 2.1%
CASH 4.1%
Saving deposit (tracking 1Y TBill) 5.9%

All of this are at decent gains, except for DELL which is currently at a -27% loss and I am planning to cut it entirely. IONQ obviously has achieved an extreme gain and I am aware of the concentration risk. I have a price in mind at which I will trim some profit, but I am comfortable with the risk of seeing my portfolio volatility spiking up just because of that position.

In addition to the above holdings and outside of my trading account, I have another 10% in my banking account and I am saving for a mortgage deposit over the next year. Pension contribution is sorted out and my income and earning potential are decent enough to afford the investment risk of my portfolio. 

QQQ and IWQU are the two long term holdings that I am building; I plan to increase these two over time with further contributions and gains from other positions.

CASH is there for buying opportunities if the market dips at any point.

SAVING DEPOSIT might be invested or transferred to my bank account for the mortgage deposit.

I'd like to have your opinion for what I am planning to do with my holdings. I am thinking of the following alternatives:

- sell DELL and LVMH and invest everything in QQQ and IWQU with a 70/30 split
- sell DELL, keep some in CASH, invest the rest in other high risks names that I have been following. 

The reason of these two alternatives is that I prefer not to touch IONQ because it has the potential to generate a life changing wealth, but if I lose it all I am okay with it, and as such I'd rather raise cash from a low growth holding (DELL) and from LVMH that might still grow but I am okay with the profit that I made so far.

1hfjvh8,1734358096.0,2.5 year follow-up on buying the dip on pandemic stocks,"I bought the dip on several 'pandemic stocks' that had significant declines (70%+) in 2022 and started sharing public updates 1-2 times a year.

In Q3 2023 I began reallocating into AI-related stocks when I developed strong conviction. I'm also working on a self-funded AI startup, which keeps me in the loop on AI.

Returns have been strong and continue to give me the runway to work on my startup and support my family after leaving my corporate tech job. There's more context in my previous updates linked below.

(*\*) Short term capital gain/loss held for <1yr*

I held several companies (\*) for a short time to spread out my AI bets, but some of the increasingly high P/E ratios concerned me (PLTR, TSLA, etc.).

So, I sold them and purchased more NVIDIA. This approach is considered risky, but I have strong conviction in their relative valuation, defensibility, and long-term prospects.

In this case I believe that 'diversification' among AI stocks would do more to dilute my returns than mitigate my risks. Particularly because they're all highly correlated and despite its market cap, Nvidia has the most reasonable valuation all things considered. We'll see if the bet pays off.

To clarify, I am confident in the long-term prospects of Palantir, Tesla, and others, but I'm just not comfortable with the valuations. I may reassess in the future when I have new information or valuations change.

Meta is the only other stock I held onto, given my bullish view on their AI and hardware strategy combined with their attractive valuation.

# Unrealized (current investments)

* **Meta (META):** \+367.97%
* **Nvidia (NVDA):** \+117.05%

Nvidia's performance here is understated since I recently increased my holdings, but it's up \~200% since I initially purchased it last year after dithering for months.

These returns are less impactful without the values or relative weights, but I’d like to maintain some anonymity around it.

# Rate of return (IRR)

My annual return (IRR) for this portfolio (Jun 2022 to Dec 2024) is **73.6%**.

# Investment thesis

See a summary of my investment thesis in a [previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17mzc07/15_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/). **TL;DR:**

>“…AI is another secular trend like PCs (Windows, Mac), the internet (browsers, search, social) and mobile (iOS, Android, wearables). The difference is that new technology like AI can now spread faster than ever before and get used in new ways. Every new epoch uniquely benefits from the past, potentially bending the growth curve in new ways.

>The other difference is that Nvidia has a monopoly position on the core technology driving this innovation. Therefore, the \~350% run up over the last 12 months doesn’t make NVIDIA the stock of the last year, but rather it’s the stock of the next decade. The recent 3X gain will be a blip compared to what’s coming thanks to NVIDIA’s CUDA (moat), among [other things](https://stratechery.com/2023/nvidia-on-the-mountaintop/).”

# Nvidia's dominance

I'm still working through my thoughts here, but my strong conviction around Nvidia comes in part from these observations:

* Nvidia is [founder-led](https://www.amazon.com/Nvidia-Way-Jensen-Huang-Making/dp/1324086718/) and focuses on accelerated computing while remaining broad enough to allow for innovation and insight across industries where it can apply its core competencies.
* It's unprecedented to have such dominance in such a fast-growing, valuable industry while maintaining such a long-term sustainable advantage.
* This advantage is due to unreasonable investments (research, hardware, software, ecosystem, relationships) over decades, making it hard to copy.
* AI will consistently make software easier to create, thus reducing the moats of software companies and make them less attractive than hardware companies (for now).
* Despite their impressive growth, Nvidia is still supply constrained, which is fundamentally easier to predict than demand constraints.

# We still underestimate the AI opportunity

Most importantly, we’ve barely scratched the surface of AI’s opportunities and benefits. Even the most ambitious targets underestimate it because the better and cheaper AI gets, the more use cases we'll find.

We have a habit of confusing the limits of our imagination with the limits of reality. Our imaginations are trained on what happened before, but there has never been anything like this before.

# Final thoughts

I'm still well within the '*maybe I'm just lucky*' phase since it's only been a couple years. Towards the end of [my last update](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1d758m7/2_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/) I also shared a few ways my investment approach has changed, which I’m still benefiting from.

I expect my next update to be the 3-year update in mid 2025.

**UPDATE:** Thanks for mentioning I should have included indexes for benchmark context. Indexes like QQQ and S&P 500 also had good returns during the same period (June 2022 - Dec 2024). For an apples to apples comparison, the IRR of QQQ and S&P 500 respectively during this period were \~24% and \~16%.",840,184,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1hfjvh8/25_year_followup_on_buying_the_dip_on_pandemic/
1hfea7v,1734335853.0,Investing in publicly-traded assets to benefit from AI automation,"What are the best strategies/channels to access investments that are hypothesized to benefit from advancements in AI and agentic workflow automation?

Are there funds focused on this? I'm specifically thinking about how some big public incumbent companies will be hurt by it (like Chegg) and others will greatly benefit from it. There must be a number of criteria that can be evaluated based on publicly available data and are hypothesized to correlate with positive financial outcomes in the age of AI automation. For example:

\-big white collar labor expenditures as a percentage of revenue and costs, indicating an outsized return on bottom line EBITDA from investing in AI automation

\-large audiences

\-large proprietary databases and content

\-large R&D budgets

\-defensible network effects. etc.

How can I easily and effectively invest to benefit from these kinds of hypotheses? For the sake of focus, fine to focus the conversation on publicly traded stocks and funds.

I know there are AI tools to analyze SEC filings, and I could build a list of hypotheses to evaluate, but this is a lot of work and others are better suited to do it than I (and I assume already have).

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I kinda got this idea in my head that AAPL is a company without much growth left and have been thinking about lightening up my position on it.

So I decided to make some graphs to figure out what to think and because pictures easy raw data hard. 

First off I was curious what apple's shares outstanding looked like. I know their buy back program is massive and I also know they're not growing top line revenue but are spending a ton on buybacks so this was a good place to start. Considering the share price has also been going up a lot and their market cap is massive so I thought buybacks might have a negligible effect. Wow was I wrong. The shares outstanding are down like 36% in ten years! I couldn't ask for a better looking chart. At this rate it'll all be bought back in like 18.9 more years.

Then I was obviously curious about the EPS and decided to graph that. I was less surprised about how this turned out but it did still offer some insights. I hadn't seen before that they had multiple recent periods of EPS decline that they managed to turn around in big ways. And their EPS since covid is surprisingly down less than I thought so that's not so bad.

It doesn't change my opinion that their product lines are basically stagnant and not exactly innovative on a level that would spur a ton of growth, who tf needs another slimmer iPhone, iPad etc and I think that's a pretty widely held belief given the charts.

However, it's pretty crazy to see that they've bought back a 3rd of their shares in the past 9 years. Also pretty wild to see how its EPS has grown despite not a lot of innovation.

Lastly I was curious how their wearables revenue was doing because I heard recently about the FDA approving AirPods to be hearing devices which is probably a huge market? IDK but what I do know is hearing aids are stupid expensive compared to $200 air pods so this could be big. So far it looks like wearables is doing about $9B a quarter so if growth in that picked up it could be meaningful

All in all I think I keep my position the same, especially considering most of it is through SPYG which has AAPL and NVDA nearly the same weights which kinda strikes me as a yin and yang sorta situation.

Regards, grab your tendies and gather around the fire because I’m going to tell you all about *$GOOG* (aka Alphabet) the BFTG (Big Fucking ~~Tech~~ Tendie Giant). I’ll break it down for you because I know you polish that 🧠 real nice so I can’t expect a single wrinkle. 

1. Criminally Low P/E Ratio

While all your other tech darlings are flexing P/E ratios like a hooker in heat, $GOOGL is at 23.4 P/E ratio.

For reference:
* $SPX: >27 P/E (yes, the S&P500)
* $MSFT: >36 P/E
* $AAPL: >39 P/E
* $NVDA: >56 P/E
* $AMZN: >47 P/E
* $TSLA: >106 P/E (Fuck you, for the window lickers in the back)

Remember a “good” P/E ratio is traditionally around 20-25. If you don’t understand then read a fucking book.

2. AI Incumming

Sure, everyone’s talking about OpenAI and ChatGPT, but who’s making real money here? Google owns 90%+ of search traffic (when did you ever hear “yahoo it” or “ask duck duck go”?) and monetizes it like a legal cartel. Once Gemini (+Legacy Bard) gets some improvements and a little lipstick even MORE money. Oh, and don’t forget Google Cloud, which grew revenues 30% YoY last quarter.

3. Santa Rally - Ho Ho Hold Onto Your Bollocks 🎅

Historically, December is green season for big-cap tech. Funds rebalance, and retail apes are YOLOing. The Santa Rally isn’t just a meme; it’s a statistical goldmine. With $GOOG’s recent earnings beat ($28.5B in 3 months), the market’s about to price this in as snow starts falling.

4. Big Tech = Safe Haven

Recession? Inflation? Global chaos? Who cares. Big Tech don’t give a *FUCK*. Ad spending may wobble, but companies will NEVER stop buying Google ads.

5. Buybacks on Steroids

$GOOGL has a $70 BILLION buyback program active, the best part? They’re buying low and will push us even higher.

TL;DR: Google Is The Perfect Combo of Value & Growth.

This image below is a bunch of large companies that represent the SPY. The colored areas are their earnings (with their predicted earnings in a lighter shade) and the black line is their combined market cap (price).

[https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02](https://imgur.com/a/GoOoF02)  
I've annotated a few arrows to explain what seems to have roughly happened.

**Orange Arrow 2020 - 2022:** Interest rates drop which causes excess liquidity to flood the market. Those who already had assets saw huge portfolio increases. This new wealth combined with low interest caused a housing price boom. New money in the hands of retail caused cults to form around memes like GME. Plus no one wants to work and is wfh.

**Red Arrow 2022:** A ""lost decade"" is a period of time where new investors have no access to good investments. People who just started working in 2022 or decided to start investing in 2022 had no good place to put their money and would only have broken even in 2024. (the horizontal dash). In a larger crisis like with Japan's lost decade(s) you have 10-20 years where the stock market effectively grinds sideways. 

**Red & Orange**

[https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb](https://imgur.com/a/FD8zYAb)

If you overlay the SPY with the Fed's interest rate policy you can see that it looks to have caused some temporary price distress but long term the price is correlated with earnings, not interest rate.  A ""lost decade"" is effectively exuberance that ""pulls forward"" price appreciation and ""steals"" it from future investors. 

In the COVID response, those who had assets in 2020 benefited while those who started investing in 2022 had a difficult time b/c they didn't have access to the exponential growth of markets.

**Blue Line**

Long term investors who think in decades and don't actually need large purchases like cars or weddings (like old people...) can just ignore these bumps and focus on long term earnings.

\---

The above is obviously over-simplified but it's an example of how using earnings and price in tandem allows you to see the underlying story behind price movement.

If you just focus on price, all you can do is draw a line up and the right and say things that are true like ""AAPL is a good company""

[https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p](https://imgur.com/a/5L07X9p)

You have no perspective.

The worst example is someone who got scared of investing in stocks in 2020 but seeing everyone around him get rich for 2 years he decides to start investing in 2022 and loses money for two years and decides to stop and then starts watching everyone around him make more money... in a never-ending spiral of 2 year delayed FOMO.

It's like relying on a tourist pamphlet in a foreign city. If you can't make a judgement of quality independently then you will always pay high prices and wait in long lines.",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h8fr0c/covid_as_a_mini_lost_decade/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

And you are doing, say $200 per month or perhaps $500 every quarter (more or less, depending on your financial situations) per stock.

1) At what stage of the stock's life would you then decide to stop DCA? Especially for stocks like MSFT and AAPL that have been around for a long while?

2) Also, while you DCA, would you also sell your initial amount you bought? Or you'd let it ride?

1h75r9y,1733392621.0,TSMC in talks with Nvidia for AI chip production in Arizona,"Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is in discussions with Nvidia Corp to produce its Blackwell artificial intelligence chips at the contract manufacturer's new plant in Arizona, three sources familiar with the matter said.

TSMC is already making preparations to start production early next year, the sources said.

Nvidia's Blackwell chips, which the company unveiled in March, have so far been manufactured at TSMC's facilities in Taiwan. The company has seen high demand from customers involved in generative AI and accelerated computing for the chips, which it says is 30 times speedier at tasks like serving up answers from chatbots.

The agreement, if finalised, would secure another customer for TSMC's Arizona facility, which is scheduled to start volume production next year.

TSMC and Nvidia declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the talks were confidential.

Two of the sources said Apple (AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are current customers at the Arizona plant. Apple and AMD did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, while TSMC plans to produce the front-end process of Nvidia's Blackwell chips in Arizona, the chips will still need to be shipped back to Taiwan for packaging. The Arizona facility does not have chip on wafer on substrate (CoWoS) capacity that is essential to the Blackwell chips, two of the sources said.

All of TSMC's CoWoS capacity is currently in Taiwan.

Taiwan's TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is investing tens of billions of dollars in building three facilities in Phoenix and the project has won significant subsidies from the U.S. government which wants to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the United States.

1h5wads,1733255385.0,Investment Advice- Rebalancing?,"I am looking for some advice on my current portfolio and savings plan.

I'm a fairly recent immigrant to this country (36m) so started my retirement/ savings from scratch in my early 30's. Currently live in a very HCOL city on the west coast, making around 100-150k/ year running my own business as an S corp, where I pay myself a W2 salary thats roughly 60% of my income, which i adjust regularly to stay ahead of taxes. The nature of my work is project based and freelance so every month is different. This year I am paying myself approx 6k gross per month on w2. The remainder of the income from the business and other 1099 income I usually manage to write off completely as I invest it back into the business.

My main expense is rent and utilities, other than that I have no other debt (paid off car, no student debt) aside from small credit card bills (under 3k that I pay off monthly- no interest)

  
**Current Accounts and Savings:**

  
Personal Checking Account- $3k, keep this empty for monthly expenses only. Zero interest. I view this as a pass through account- salary in, bills out.

Business Checking Account- $20k, this account fluctuates a lot depending on cash flow, I usually try to keep it around $20k- thinking I could/ should move at least 50% into an account that accrues some interest. 

SEP IRA (Deductible)- 25k, I max out the contribution yearly, 25% of my w2 income (started this in 2022) I divide that total amount by 12 and make 12 monthly DCA buys into VTI. That's it. Could possibly just start dropping a lump sum?

ROTH IRA- 18k, Maxing this out every year. $500 monthly DCA buys into VTI (50%) VOO (40%) and 10% cash.

M1 Investment Account- $3k, started this is March of this year to start putting some money into some individual stocks and slightly more speculative plays. $100 weekly DCA buys into a basket of stocks MSTR, TSLA, NVDA, AMZN, AAPL, V, LLY  etc. I like to own individual names and regular DCA just keeps the guesswork out.

Regular Brokerage Account- $1.5k, use this for the occasional weekly/ monthly option contract. Any gains over 1.5k just get emptied into the ROTH. I regularly generate 400-500 per month from this account, so most months i don't even need to fund my ROTH from my personal account.

Chase Investment Account- $14k, $400 monthly contribtions, this was a Chase Auto Invest account (mid risk) that yielded about 10%, so below avg market returns. Chase has ended this auto investment service so the money is 80% invested into various funds but the new contributions will just be cash unless i Manually buy new funds. As this has been underperforming the market, i'm thinking about splitting this up over a few of my other accounts to streamline.

  
Crypto- $20k, been buying $100 of BTC weekly for years. Occasionally add bigger lumps on big dips. Will continue this DCA strategy.

  
So my currently contributions to all my accounts are :

  
SEP IRA- 1k monthly DCA into VTI  
ROTH IRA- $500 monthly DCA into VTI/ VOO  
M1- $400 monthly DCA into various QQQ type stocks  
Chase Invest- $400 monthly DCA into money market  
Crypto- $400 DCA into BTC  


I don't really ever sell stocks or funds, unless they become seriously overweight, or I need the cash, which hasn't happened so far.

I'm fairly happy with the amount that I am able to save and invest monthly, just wondering if anyone had advice on how I could streamline this approach, or if there are other account types or assets I should consider. The monthly DCA strategy just works for me because it means I really don't worry too much about market movements, I actually prefer to see prices go down so i can buy more cheaper. 

TLDR: Please critique my current investment strategy, are there any other account types i should be contributing to regularly to build wealth for the future and how could i manage my regular buys/ DCA/ contributions more effectively?",0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1h5wads/investment_advice_rebalancing/

It is worth noting that since April this year, Apple's share price ushered in a sustained rise, has risen more than 45% over the closing low point on April 19 this year. The strong performance of Apple's stock price not only reflects the company's growth momentum, but also shows investors' confidence in its future development. What are the driving factors behind this upward trend?

  
Outstanding earnings performance. In the fourth fiscal quarter, when the new generation of iPhones just hit the market, the revenue of Apple's core product, iPhone, returned to positive growth, and the growth momentum exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driving the company's total revenue to a record high for the same period. The solid financial situation undoubtedly provides investors with confidence.

Technology innovation and AI strategic layout. While the core products are changing, Apple is also launching new products, from Apple Watch to smart home products, to meet the diversified needs of consumers. In addition, Apple's continued expansion in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence has laid the foundation for its future growth with the gradual release of Apple's AI capabilities.

Global market expansion. Apple's sales revenue in Europe, Japan and other Asia-Pacific regions outside of China and Japan all accelerated in the fourth fiscal quarter, such as India, Southeast Asia and Africa, which have low smartphone penetration rates and huge market potential, are also growing rapidly. At the same time, Apple is also promoting the relocation of the industrial chain, especially to emerging markets such as India, with a view to further reducing costs, expanding production capacity and developing new market growth points.

So like the degenerate I am, I pulled almost 60k from my EF and proceeded to lose about half from google and apple until apple finally had a good day. 


The last 2 weeks I have come back with my biggest winners being Disney, Walmart and Snow. Outside of Walmart, I only played straddles with the last few being 12/20 expiries. I’m pulling out $160k to bolster the EF and play with the rest. ",85,21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gwj01d

“Should I invest with the bank or would you want to help me?”

I told her i’d help her. She doesn’t like much risk in any areas of her life so i’m thinking on focusing her portfolio on ETFs (VOO, SCHD) or simply just the S&P 500. 

Also thought about dividend paying companies (KO, O) or large caps like AAPL, MFST etc. 

Considering the bull market, a lot of non investors have been getting excited about the market recently. We’re at/near market ATH so I feel like I should tell her to hold off for a bit and wait for a dip but you can never time the market.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

I have a high exposure to AAPL and it has served me well. With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. 

Also, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.

Do you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks?

1gi2s7x,1730571638.0,Globalstar and Apple expanded partnership ,"Does anyone have anymore information on Globalstar GSAT and Apple AAPL expanded partnership? Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.

Here is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? 

The expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  
Potential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.
3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.
Potential Risks  
1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  
2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.
In the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.

1ggrvy7,1730416747.0,Trimming Appl before Berkshire results tomorrow ,"Investors may want to consider trimming their Apple (AAPL) positions based on recent developments and upcoming events. Here's why:

## Apple's Recent Performance

Apple's latest earnings report has raised some concerns among investors. The company reported a decline in global iPhone sales for the second consecutive quarter, partly due to increased competition in China from companies like Huawei[3]. This slowdown in Apple's flagship product could signal challenges ahead for the tech giant.

## Berkshire Hathaway's Significant Reduction

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) has made a notable move by cutting its stake in Apple by nearly 50% during the second quarter of 2024[1][2]. This reduction came after Berkshire had already trimmed its Apple holdings by 13% in the first quarter[1]. Such a significant divestment by a long-term, value-focused investor like Buffett could be interpreted as a cautionary signal.

## Potential for Further Trimming

With Berkshire Hathaway set to report earnings tomorrow, investors should pay close attention. Apple's stock price has risen by approximately $15 since the end of September when Berkshire made its substantial cut. This increase, coupled with Berkshire's recent selling pattern, suggests that another trim in Berkshire's Apple holdings is possible[4].

## Broader Market Considerations

Berkshire's actions may reflect broader concerns about the U.S. economy. The company has increased its cash reserves to a record $277 billion, which could indicate a more cautious outlook on equities in general[5]. This substantial cash position might be seen as a hedge against potential market volatility or economic uncertainty.

## Investor Takeaway

While Apple remains a strong company with significant market presence, these factors combined suggest that investors might want to reassess their positions:

1. Apple's slowing iPhone sales and increased competition
2. Berkshire's substantial reduction in Apple holdings
3. The possibility of further trimming by Berkshire
4. Overall market and economic uncertainties

Given that the onions for appl options will be down after earnings, this would be an excellent time to short appl. This is not financial advice.

1ge79db,1730135004.0,Bloomberg’s estimates on the big four tech giants ,"The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.
All signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.
That backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.
To be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.
You have to walk the fine line of investing,“ said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‘so that investors understand that you're ’not going too far”.
Nvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.
Of course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.",39,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ge79db/bloombergs_estimates_on_the_big_four_tech_giants/

Let me lube you guys up with a small play this monday to get in the mood.

Today I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they’ll be in the TLDR at the bottom.

1. **CROX** \- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.
2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.

Not sure If there is a benefit ,"I just hit 100k in my portfolio with 52% in SP500 (all VOO) and now interested in switching to go heavier in dividend stocks. My portfolios other holdings are “safe” TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL…The two dividend stocks I’m holding are monthly paid dividend all reinvested, (SCM, GLAD) earning me $20 and change a month each and have not lost capital. For some reason my mind is telling me to open a new brokerage account dedicated to only dividend and let my 100k sit dormant, is there any upside to this or is the same as putting money in my current account just reallocate the automatic funds from going to VOO into the dividend stocks. Still kind of hesitant to stop investing in the SP all together. I have a ROTH that is maxed out every year and contribute 6% to my 401k with a 4% company match.

After I made my money, I switched to shares, and using a little bit of leverage which is less than 10% of my capital.

Only reason I'm green is because of the tech rally, and a strong market we are in right now. I bought the dips and hoped for a turn around I did absolutely no technical analysis or due diligence. My theory is that the markets eventually gotta go up bro and somehow I made it. and not only that I beat the S&P 500 return since I ever started. My mentality was most gamblers lose before they hit it big, I kept going it was either I'm down 100% or I'm making this money back.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1gbge41,1729812209.0,Expectations for Berkshire pre-election,"Recently Berkshire Hathaway has seen a pull-back from its ATH of 725,000(484 for Brk.B). Although a pullback is always expected when a stock price explores to a new high, but a breakdown lower is highly unlikely and is not what I expect to see heading up to election day. Their earnings are 11/2, 3 days before election. Berkshire has never seen volatility like it has recently and that will play a huge factor in is price action. The company's core assets reside in sectors such as insurance, energy, and consumer goods. Recently they sliced their holding of $AAPL in half, reducing their position to only 2.6% of the outstanding shares. Even  after concluding their sales $AAPL remains Berkshires largest holding at roughly 30% of their portfolio. Furthermore, their cash balance sits at a whopping $277 billion.

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

1g6k31k,1729263552.0,I Flipped My Entire Portfolio of ETFs for AI Stocks,"Yesterday, I made a major shift in my stock portfolio. I used to rely on ETFs like SPY, QQQ, and SCHD, but now I’ve sold most of them and focused on NVDA, MSFT, GOOGL, ISRG, AAPL, SCHG, and a bit of SOXX.

 - NVDA $237K

Here’s why: Right now, AI might feel limited to things like ChatGPT, but its potential goes far beyond that. Over the next 3, 5, or 10 years, AI is going to transform industries in ways we can’t fully imagine yet. We’re talking about healthcare revolutionizing how we diagnose and treat patients, transportation with autonomous vehicles and drones making logistics smarter and more efficient, and manufacturing, where AI will optimize production processes and supply chains.

Now, I know what you're thinking: 'What, you think the world is full of cave dwellers? Who doesn't know that?' and you're right. Everyone knows AI techonology will be advanced and utilized in so many ways in the near future.

But look, you can think of it like real estate. Sure, property values rise while new highways or shopping centers are being built, but the real surge in value happens once people start using them and see the full benefits. Right now, AI is still in its “under construction” phase—people can imagine the future potential, but the true value hasn’t been fully realized yet. The market has priced in expectations, sure, but once AI is fully integrated across industries and we start seeing its widespread, real-world impact, I believe we’ll see another major surge in stock prices. What’s priced in now is just the beginning—the real growth will come as AI starts transforming daily life and business on a much larger scale.

Before ChatGPT went mainstream, people assumed ‘just’ that level of AI technology would arrive soon enough, but they didn’t think it would have this much of an impact on stock prices once it came to life for the public. Everyone knew advanced AI was on the horizon, but the market didn’t price it like they do now. This shows just how much underestimation happens until we truly start experiencing the technology firsthand. And that’s why, despite what’s already been priced in, I think AI stocks are still undervalued given the game-changing growth ahead. Anyone else rethinking their portfolio with AI at the center?",0,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1g6k31k/i_flipped_my_entire_portfolio_of_etfs_for_ai/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1g5z896,1729193419.0,"YoY: 56%, YTD: 35.6% - Living at home changed my life","
TL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing 

I've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.

I moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.

Pretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).

I believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).

* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)
* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)

I joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.

Was very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. Gonna smoke a joint and drink a gin and tonic.

Cheers

1g5c8cl,1729118534.0,baby’s first year trading options with prideful 250%+ YTD - AMA or roast me.,"This got removed in options for being too noob so here I am with you fellow regards.

I started trading options in March and smashed my previous ATH this week 🎉 
I’ll summarize the last 6-12 months:
For most of 2022-2023 across three accounts, both taxable and IRAs, I had been middling around 15k and not doing very well trading. In the last 6 months since I started options, I’m up over 125% with only about $200 a month deposited. I’m also up 250% YTD and 340% the past 12 months, but those include a max Roth IRA $6500 contribution. It was a pretty good time to start playing semi/AI tech, and then space startups, but of course I wish I got in sooner! 

My biggest successes have been with AAPL, TSM, and NVDA of course, then ASTS, RKLB, LUNR. 
Lost on SOFI and DKNG while getting my feet wet, then played a series of TSM calls for big wins. I needed those wins to afford any NVDA options 😂 
Had another big loss with MU, some on HIMS (I hate the stock). Have a little in OKLO shares but super pissed I didn’t grab some calls in the last few months.

*I’ll post more in comments if people ask.* I did not have a disciplined strategy, just some loose principles putting guardrails on my emotional gambling mindset (vibe check sigma grindset). I think I got slightly past the “first run is free” phase and now I can clearly see I am the next Buffett. ",49,31,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g5c8cl
1g4cmvs,1729011681.0,"""frontier tech"" portfolio ","hey all, sharing what i'm calling my ""frontier tech"" portfolio, broken down by percentages. i'm looking for valuable input, feedback, and discussion around it. and, if it happens to be helpful to anyone, even better. i do want to clarify a few things:

* i'm focused on AI, bitcoin, and space. investment vehicles or not, i simply think each are tech frontiers that hold tons of promise, are poised for massive growth, and will bring immense amounts of value to the world over the next few decades. let's just call this a ""frontier tech"" portfolio, to give it a name i can reference.
* i'm not looking for feedback that just disagrees with that thesis. whether you think AI is all hype, or you are anti-Bitcoin and think it's a ponzi scheme, or you think space is a waste of resources, or anything along these lines - that's ok, i respect that perspective, but i'd like to avoid arguing about it. we just disagree about some fundamental things, and you won't convince me i'm simply wrong.
* i AM looking for feedback on blind spots, poor/missing assumptions, overconfidence, things i'm not considering, or any other constructive input that falls within the framework of the overall thesis. i'm not just looking for people to agree with me (though that is interesting input as well) - i just want feedback that can be applied within my overall investing philosophy.
* yes, i'm missing some key areas of what many would call ""frontier tech"" - biotech, green / nuclear energy, cybersecurity, to name a few - but i just don't have the same level of confidence in specific areas of those. i prefer to stay relatively focused on the categories where i'm most confident and able to stay up to date.
* i'm trying to keep my language somewhat appealing to a wide audience. not looking to get too bogged down in technical details or language that would alienate someone reading this stuff who's less familiar with one or any of the spaces/categories.
* my primary goal is a portfolio of funds and stocks that i can invest in with *strong long-term confidence in growth.* not stuff i trade frequently. and not stuff i love the idea of or that seems interesting / sexy but that i don't know enough about (SMCI, PLTR, altcoins as some good examples). i also generally prefer companies whose leadership i trust and/or admire.

ok, with that out of the way, let's dive in:

**30% AI** - 10% NVDA, 5% SOXQ, 15% balanced mixed of NOW, MSFT, AAPL, GOOGL, META, AMZN

* HIGH LEVEL: to me, this category is ABSOLUTELY going to change our world in fundamental ways over the next several decades. AI's potential is not chatGPT, or smarter versions of it. it's far beyond what we're seeing from LLMs today. if you listen to the engineers and operational leaders within the AI space, listen to not what they ""believe"" is gonna happen, but to what they know is coming because they've already used the tech, usually 1-2 years before the public even sees it, these people are overwhelmed, amazed, terrified, enchanted, bewildered. to me, that's just very interesting. i believe what some others do - that we're in the midst or on the verge of another technological revolution. i'm not bothered much that AI isn't monetizing in demonstrable, repeatable ways. i think there's been and continues to be enough fundamental, increasing advancement in this field that the value creation will absolutely surpass what most people think. as for the individual stocks, i'll do a quick dive here. to be clear, I don't think these are groundbreaking choices and many are very obvious. but, seems useful to give my favorite things about each:
* 10% NVDA - these guys are and will continue to be at the center of the whole thing. their moat is extensive. it's not just GPU / blackwell demand. it's their CUDA programming language and universe, and stickiness of it. it's the long-term horizon required for their data centers that makes 5-10 year customers out of everyone who buys their stuff. it's CEO jensen pushing them and already looking for the ""next big thing."" just a lot of confidence here.
* 5% SOXQ - i like this semiconductor ETF a little more than SMH because it's more diverse (SMH is like 25% NVDA, which is great if i didn't already allocate so much there), and it's got a low expense ratio (0.19%). i love this exposure because the AI industry is driven by these companies (e.g. TSMC, Micron, Broadcam, Qualcomm, AMD, AMAT).
* 15% mix of these...
   * NOW - excellent leadership and integrated heavily with NVDA tech; will benefit hugely from AI boom with AI-driven automation
   * META - founder-run and with a clear vision; demonstrating enormous resources and focus on building AI models, meeting consumer needs, being pioneers in tech at large
   * AAPL - will probably benefit the most from consumer-facing AI products and implementation; strong leadership
   * AMZN - AWS is a profit monster that will be huge for AI tools and services and data centers; logistics and ecom will be big AI beneficiaries; strong leadership
   * MSFT - deeply embedded in the AI revolution with its investment in OpenAI + AI integration into Azure and Microsoft 365; excellent leadership
   * GOOGL - AI pioneer with DeepMind / Brain; they still own search; have enormous amount of data; questionable leadership but I'm holding for now
* No TSLA??? no. i just don't trust elon musk enough at this point. and i need confidence in a company's leadership for me to invest in its stock. there's a big chance i'm missing out (their robotics division might be incredible), but I'm able to sleep OK with that.
* i'm also missing plenty of other AI picks. i know that. these are the ones i can invest in with the most confidence.

**30% Bitcoin** - 25% Bitcoin itself (cold storage or an ETF), 5% MSTR

* HIGH LEVEL: why Bitcoin? books have been written about it, but to shortly summarize my perspective - it's quite volatile and risky short-term, and quite growth-oriented and (thus far) safe long-term. excellent store of value. wonderful technology, math/code based, and may or may not upend some portion of the financial system. limited supply that's only decreasing over time. immutable. now adopted by many big institutions. goes on giant bull runs every 4 or so years. some days, it's hard to justify NOT putting more into this one, but for now i'm convinced that  diversification is the better long-term play.
* 20% Bitcoin - many would argue that holding actual Bitcoin, ideally off exchanges and on cold storage is the smartest play here. but there are also arguments for FBTC or IBIT (helpful in tax-advantaged accounts; trusting an ETF seems safer to some - very debatable). i do some cold storage, and some FBTC (they self-custody their Bitcoin, which not everyone does). either way, just Bitcoin. it's the only crypto play where my confidence level is very high.
* 5% MSTR - this is a leveraged Bitcoin play. strong chance it outpaces BTC growth rate during bull runs. i may shift some MSTR profits to Bitcoin over time if it starts to really offset my 4:1 BTC:MSTR ratio.

**30% Space** - 10% ASTS, 10% RKLB, 5% LUNR

* HIGH LEVEL: the tech for space finally seems to match the potential that's been talked about for decades and decades. for a while, space-x really proved this out, almost single-handedly. but we clearly have some strong other players either in or entering the category. my favorites are these three. here's why:
* 10% ASTS - you should read the kook report (google it) for a true deep dive, but to hit my high level points: they are pre-revenue but with the potential for MASSIVE growth. effectively, their satellite system aims to offer a global cellular network. think starlink but more b2b and generally better tech. they own tons of patents. they are 5+ years ahead of what many think will be a winner-takes-most race. their partners already include AT&T, Verizon, Vodafone, Rakuten, American Tower, Bell Canada, and more. they have excellent leadership. i find this a risky-ish play as they have tons to still accomplish, but the potential growth is enormous.
* 10% RKLB - effectively, a space-x competitor on smaller rockets, with a fraction of the market cap and a huge runway for growth. i think still heavily undervalued today. nerdy/awesome leadership. vertically integrated. as telecom, defense, and general research spending expands to space economy, RKLB is positioned very, very well.
* 5% LUNR - i've spent less time researching them than the other two, but my confidence level in the risk/reward is still pretty high. key player in the lunar economy - one of few companies that can deliver payloads to the moon. very niche but valuable moat. huge potential, good amount of risks ahead.

**10% cash** - ...to buy them juicy dips.

ok, that's my ""frontier tech"" portfolio summary. to repeat - this is what i can confidently invest in for what i believe will be better-than-average returns over the next 10+ years. i recognize that this discussion didn't even really touch share price, EPS, P/E, profitability, revenue, or other key details. this just isn't the place where i'm getting into that. i can say that i'm comfortable with the financial metrics and details regarding these companies. but this discussion is mainly focused on what categories i think are poised for the most growth, and what companies/stocks/assets in those categories seem to be most positioned to lead that growth. thanks for reading.

1g0evmf,1728552596.0,"When will ""investor"" delusion end?","I'm new, please don't bully me, I have no clue what is going on which is why I use really basic concepts in my explanation.

Growth Investment vs. Value Investment.  

One one hand, there are growth stocks; Wall Street currently is in overdrive, investors are hyper-optimistic and companies like tickers: TSMC and NVDA are trading far above their average P/E ratios, these types of companies are called growth stocks because investors are betting that in the future, their “valuations” will be justified by NVDA’s performance, instead of investing in intrinsic value, shareholders are investing in the IMPLICIT VALUE of a company, which is what they perceive the future intrinsic value of a company will be. 

When the economy is doing well (as it is now, kinda, I think), growth stocks do well; this is because demand for goods and services goes up, interest rates go down, revenues for businesses go up, borrowing is cheaper and technology companies like NVDA can capitalize off of that to fund R&D, growing the scale of operations and benefitting from economies of scale, justifying the IMPLICIT VALUATIONS, raising stock prices to the stratosphere. 

On the other hand, when the economy is receding as part of its natural cycle, the economy gets a “reality check”, investors realize that their growth valuations were too optimistic and that their predictions won’t mature soon enough to achieve their desired ROI per annum. As a result, they flock to value investments because they realize that companies like Bank of America are resilient, undervalued and going to grow in a high-interest environment which we could be looking at in December. 

The same thing happens in a bubble, and it is no secret that AI is a bubble as of now considering the ludicrous difference in implicit and intrinsic valuations. 

Looking at NVDA, it is easy to see how we could be looking at the first half of a repeat of the 3D Printing bubble in 2014.  

That is not to say that, 3D printing is akin to AI, however, it is almost guaranteed that NVDA fill be facing a significant correction (like AAPL did in December 2022 and December 2023) after a rally due to the incoming CPI data (unlike AAPL). 

We are too late to invest in growth stocks and too early to buy value stocks, so we are faced with a dilemma: 



How can we invest on the tipping point of the economy’s growth? 

To be honest, I have no fucking clue, however, with CPI data coming 8:00 E.T, that could change: if CPI is significantly higher than before, a world of high interest rate December will become much more visible, if it is significantly lower, then we will see a big rally for companies like NVDA. Anything in between a clear-cut CPI , will just muddy the waters as the stock market is rife with AI speculative delusion. 

What is certain, however, is that NVDA, sooner or later, will get a really painful reality check, and if you don’t believe me, you shouldn't, because I don't know what I'm yapping about.

What is going to happen? Are my puts fucked?

TSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw September-quarter revenue of NT$759.69B (adding revenues for July NT$256.95B, August NT$250.87B and September NT$251.87B) (about $23.6B).

The average analyst forecast is NT$748B, according to a report by Bloomberg News.

While announcing its second quarter results in July, TSM said it expected third quarter revenue to be between $22.4B and $23.2B (midpoint of $22.8B). For the third quarter, the company expected its business to be helped by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for its leading-edge process technologies.

1ftwftk,1727810140.0,Challenge to find stocks matching 13 attributes of Peter Lynch,"I tried to find modern examples to each attribute mentioned in Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street. Then I thought this community could find better fits and have fun together. So please share you candidates for any category below - maybe we discover hidden gems along the way.

RECAP: Chapter 8 of One Up on Wall Street is  filled with fundamental yet profound strategies.  Invest in simple, easy-to-understand businesses over complex ones.  Identify undervalued companies with stable returns and less competition. And, search for as many of 13 attributes of the hypothetically ""perfect company."" The dream attributes of such a company go as:

***It Sounds Dull—Or Even Better Ridiculous:***

Companies with unexciting or absurd names often go unnoticed and can be undervalued, providing excellent buying opportunities. Lynch highlights that these companies are typically engaged in simple, straightforward businesses and the duller the name, the better the prospects could be.

My examples: Duckhorn Portfolio (NAPA) & The Lovesac Company (LOVE)

***It Does Something Dull:***

Companies engaged in mundane or straightforward businesses might not attract attention but often provide stable and increasing returns. Lynch appreciates companies that do boring things as they are less likely to be in the limelight and more likely to be undervalued.

My examples: Waste Management (WM) & Stepan Company (SCL)

***It Does Something Disagreeable:***

Businesses involved in unpleasant industries (like waste management) are often overlooked. Their disagreeable nature keeps them under the radar of most investors, potentially leading to lower valuations and higher returns for those willing to invest in them.

My Examples: Altria Group (MO), cannabis companies and Caesars Entertainment (CZR)

***It’s a Spinoff:***

Corporate spinoffs often result in profitable investment opportunities. Parent companies usually ensure that spinoffs have strong balance sheets and are well-positioned for success, leading to lucrative investments.

Found a good website on this: [https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/](https://thezenofinvesting.com/recent-spinoffs/)

***The Institutions Don’t Own It, and The Analysts Don’t Follow It:***

Stocks with little to no institutional ownership and minimal analyst coverage can indicate untapped potential. These ""ignored"" stocks might offer significant opportunities for gains before they become mainstream.

My examples: Denny's Corporation (DENN) & Turtle Beach Corporation (HEAR)

***The Rumors Abound: It’s Involved with Toxic Waste and/or the Mafia:***

Lynch points out that companies involved in industries surrounded by rumors or negative perceptions, like waste management or alleged Mafia connections, can offer hidden value. The negative stigma leads to fewer investors and potentially lower valuations.

My examples: **Clean Harbors (CLH)** & Boyd Gaming (BYD)

***There’s Something Depressing About It:***

Companies operating in industries that deal with the less pleasant aspects of life, like funeral services, often have consistent demand and face little competition. They are typically ignored by the larger investing community, providing opportunities for higher returns.

My examples: Service Corporation International (SCI) & Matthews International Corporation (MATW)

***It’s a No-Growth Industry:***

Contrary to popular belief, Lynch prefers investing in low or no-growth industries as they tend to have less competition and more predictable business. The stability and predictability of such industries can lead to steady returns.

My examples: Consolidated Edison (ED) & American Water Works (AWK)

***It’s Got a Niche:***

A strong niche market provides a company with a competitive edge and often a virtual monopoly in its area. Niche companies can control pricing and enjoy high barriers to entry for competitors, often leading to sustained profits

My examples: Idexx Laboratories (IDXX) & WD-40 Company (WDFC)

***People Have to Keep Buying It:***

Lynch prefers investing in companies that make essential, habitual or addictive products like drugs, soft drinks, or cigarettes over those making fickle products, as continuous buying ensures steady business.

My examples: Procter & Gamble (PG) & Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY)

***It's a User of Technology:***

Companies that effectively utilize technology to reduce costs or enhance services are appealing. For example, a company benefiting from the technological price war, like Automatic Data Processing using cheaper computers to increase its profitability, is a better bet than the companies making the computers.

My examples: Walmart (WMT) & Domino’s Pizza (DPZ)

***The Insiders are Buyers:***

Insider buying is a strong positive signal. If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.

My examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)

***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***

Companies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.

My examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",38,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ftwftk/challenge_to_find_stocks_matching_13_attributes/
1ftqqw0,1727796185.0,The Crash of the stock market has arrived. Price/Earnings ratio just broke 30 for the entire S&P 500. ,"Almost 90 days ago I made a post in an alternate subreddit regarding why I believe the stock market will begin to crash within 120 days -- Essentially the crash will begin by the day before the election. I have included that entire post below -- and all of these reasons still remain relevant... Moreso than ever with the news from the Middle East today. Obviously the port strike is expediting things today. Nonetheless -- I think the post is super relevant, and for some reason, the moderators of WSB deleted the post after 6 hours, despite it receiving over 2.2 million views, and over 1100 shares. 

The ride the market has been on, quite simply, has been insane.

According to generally accepted wisdom -- by investing in the S&P 500, you can anticipate to double your money, on average, every 6.5 years. I'm not 100% certain as to why that's the accepted figure -- as calculating the last 14 6.5 year periods the average rate of return has been 64%.

Below is a chart of the average price/rate of return of GSPC (The S&P) over the last 14 cycles.. I couldn't easily find data prior to this..

|Year|GSPC Price|6.5 year return on investment|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|1933.5|10.91||
|1940|12.05|10.44%|
|1946.5|18.43|52.95%|
|1953|26.38|43.13%|
|1959.5|58.68|122%|
|1966|92.88|58%|
|1972.5|107.14|15%|
|1979|99.93|-7.22%|
|1985.5|191.85|91.90%|
|1992|408.78|113%|
|1998.5|1133.84|177%|
|2005|1181.27|4.10%|
|2011.5|1320.64|11.70%|
|2018|2471.65|87.10%|
|2024.5|5525.29|123%|

While the last two cycles don't necessarily ring any alarm bells -- we have just more than doubled, twice, looking at the last two cycles -- There is one massive, bloated, shit filled elephant in the room... Price to Earnings Ratio.

Historically, the Price to Earnings ratio for the S&P has sat just under 20 (the easiest data I could find puts it at 19.4x between 1974 and 2017 -- I'm not grabbing any arbitrary dates or numbers here). The Median value has it under 18x, and there have even been extended periods of time where it traded at +/- 10x.

Currently -- the P/E ratio sits at 28.71 -- roughly 150% of what is normal.

In the history of the S&P, the P/E ratio has hit this level only 3 times...

* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Dot Com Bubble (P/E broke 30 +/- April 2001).
* Immediately preceding, and then during, the Global Financial Crisis (P/E broke 30 +/- October 2008).
* The quarter after Covid hit. (P/E broke 30 +/- March 2020).

Images aren't allowed in this subreddit -- but if you go to the multpl website you will see we finished trading yesterday, 09/30, at a P/E of 30.07

Historically -- what has happened to the markets after crossing this mark? In all three scenarios, by the time we crossed a P/E of 30, the dam had already started to break.

* During the Dot Com bubble, the S&P 500 was already down 19% from its highs, and would fall another 34% before finally starting to recover. By the the time the bleeding stopped, it had lost 47% of its value.
* During the global financial crisis, an almost identical story can be told. The S&P had lost 18% of its value by time P/E broke 30, and when it finally bottomed out in February of 2009, it lost 53% of its total value.
* Covid, obviously, was a much quicker recovery... as we only fell 32%, and had bounced back in less than 6 months time (reason for which outlined later).

**Okay -- so** ***Maybe*** **we have a price to earnings ratio problem, but you're still not sold. What else do we have going on?**

Outside of the fact that I firmly believe that the market is overvalued today, I think there are several other major issues that we are facing in the current environment -- and while I could write a diatribe for each, for purposes of succinctness, I'll simply outline them via bullet points below.

* Credit card debt is at an all time high, and outside of a brief period after Covid checks arrived, has been rising since 2013.
* Younger Americans are in the most trouble with credit card debt. As boomers continue to retire, it will be the working class most disproportionately affected.
* Credit card delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2011.
* Auto loans debt and average auto loan payments are the highest they've been at any point in history. Auto loan delinquency rates are the highest they've been since 2010.
* The stock market is insanely top heavy right now. The Magnificent 7 (Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA)) now account for 45% of the entire value of the Nasdaq. They account for roughly 30% of the entire stock market combined. As of today -- they are trading at a combined P/E of 42x. A correction in these 7 companies would be absolutely catastrophic for the entire market as a whole.
* We are starting to see a weakening of the labor market. Furthermore -- I do not believe the jobs numbers are entirely as they seem. I think many of the jobs 'added' over the last 18 months have been individuals picking up second jobs to help make ends meet. Any reasonable increase in the unemployment rate have absolutely massive consequences.
* Many banks are holding on to massive unrealized losses. While this has the potential to hit the regional banks the worst, some of the largest banks -- including Bank of America, Charles Schwab, and USAA have unbooked security losses that are greater than 50% of their equity capital.
* Regional banks are at risk due to the massive amounts of US treasury notes they hold that were bought during Covid. In short -- nobody was borrowing money to buy homes or cars. Banks, flush with cash, took said money and bought US T notes with this money so they could earn some interest on it. This was at a time when interest rates were very low. Now that interest rates are high -- demand for these old t notes is essentially non existent, as you buy new t notes that pay a much higher rate of return. If any sort of bank run starts, these banks will be forced to liquidate said t-bills, and they will have to sell them at a loss. If too many people do this simultaneously, the bank will become insolvent -- like what we saw happen with Silicon Valley bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank. (Side note -- the failure of these three banks alone was larger than the combined total of bank failures in 2008 during the global financial crisis).
* The US government still has a spending problem. Our deficit has grown by $500 million since I started writing this an hour ago.
* Global tensions are high -- and rising. Massive protests are erupting all over Europe.
* The US is involved in two proxy wars that don't appear as if they will abate any time soon.
* The political division in the US is as dramatic as I've seen it at any point in my existence. Perhaps those older and wiser than me can chime in here -- but it seems most are resorting to tribal, identity politics split down party lines.
* Commercial real estate is starting to buckle. Covid brought about work from home, and with many offices retaining those practices, or allowing partial work from home, office space supply far outpaces demand. This problem is exacerbated by high interest rates. Most commercial loans are done on 5 or 7 year balloon. When that balloon is bout to come due, the owner of that property will refinance the loan, restarting the 5 or 7 year period to avoid paying off the balance owed on the property. Many of these property owners that refinanced into low interest rates in 2020, during covid, when rates bottomed out -- are now having to get a new loan to keep from paying their balloon. However, with interest rates more than twice what they were several years ago, and vacancy rates skyrocketing, many of these real estate owners will not be able to pay the monthly mortgage on their buildings. Commercial Real Estate foreclosures jumped 117% in March alone.
* Housing has become increasingly less affordable for many Americans. For 2022 -- the most recent year I could find data -- a family earning the median US household income, renting a median priced US home, was spending 40% of their income on rent.
* Countries are abandoning the US dollar in droves.

I believe some of these issues, on their own, are enough to cause serious economic turmoil. Bundled together, I don't see how we aren't in for a very rude awakening.

**This economic downturn may be severe.**

In the three times this has happened before -- the action, or lake thereof varied dramatically. During scenario one -- the dot com bubble -- the government largely just let the companies fail. While I was only 11 at the time, my understanding is that there really were no bailouts here because the only people really hurt were the investors in those companies -- unlike scenario two. During the GFC, shuttering banks would have resulted in a complete collapse of the US (and really global) financial system. While I won't get into partisan politics, I'm of the belief that the covid bailouts were entirely unnecessary -- and more importantly for this post -- the reason that the upcoming crash is going to be so insanely problematic.

**Bailouts on any level, whether to companies, banks, or directly to citizens, will inevitably increase inflation. I don't think they are on the table for this correction.**

People have painted the inflation problem as a result of supply chain issues... And while supply chain issues didn't help, I think the bigger issue, by far, was the sheer amount of money we printed. You cannot make $4 trillion appear out of thin air and expect that every dollar in circulation isn't going to suddenly become worth less money. We just lived through this reality after the Covid printing.

This will largely tie the feds hands. Print more money -- we find ourselves in a cycle of ever increasing prices and higher interest rates.

**What happens from here?**

I don't know. Don't listen to me. I'm an idiot. Stock market will probably just continue to go up. I'm probably wrong about 100% of this.

The prediction in bold below is what I posted 90 days ago. I now believe the top is officially in -- that we won't see another ATH for a long time.

**The Significance of This Event**

Russia's looming stagflation—a combination of economic stagnation and high inflation—could significantly disrupt global markets due to the country's substantial role in exporting energy, metals, and agricultural commodities. Supply chain disruptions and reduced exports from Russia may lead to increased global commodity prices, affecting various industries. Companies and sectors capable of capitalizing on these shifts or mitigating associated risks are likely to see notable impacts on their financial performance.

# Sectors That May See Positive Gains, Broken Down by Key Companies

**Energy Sector**

With potential reductions in Russian oil and gas exports, global energy prices may rise, benefiting companies that can fill the supply gap or profit from higher prices.

* **Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSEAMERICAN: LNG)**
   * **Reasoning:** As the leading U.S. exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), Cheniere is well-positioned to meet increased European demand seeking alternatives to Russian gas.

   * **Reasoning:** As a major aluminum producer, Alcoa can benefit from higher aluminum prices due to reduced Russian exports.
* **Sibanye Stillwater Limited (NYSE: SBSW)**
   * **Reasoning:** With significant operations in palladium and platinum mining, Sibanye Stillwater may gain from higher prices resulting from supply shortages.
* **Vale S.A. (NYSE: VALE)**
   * **Reasoning:** Vale, a leading global producer of nickel, could benefit from increased nickel prices and demand, crucial for stainless steel and battery production.



# Sectors That May Be Hit the Hardest, Broken Down by Key Companies

**Automotive Sector**

Automakers may face challenges due to shortages and higher prices of metals like palladium and nickel.

* **Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F)**
   * **Reasoning:** Ford's production costs may increase due to higher prices for essential metals, potentially impacting profitability and pricing strategies.
* **General Motors Company (NYSE: GM)**
   * **Reasoning:** Similar supply chain pressures as Ford, with potential delays in electric vehicle (EV) production due to nickel shortages.
* **Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)**
   * **Reasoning:** Tesla's reliance on nickel for EV batteries may lead to increased costs and supply constraints, affecting production targets.

**Aerospace and Aviation Sector**

Dependency on Russian titanium and increased fuel costs can negatively impact this sector.

# Conclusion

In reassessing my recommendations, I have refined the list of companies and ETFs to ensure they represent the most strategic picks for investors considering the potential impacts of Russia's stagflation on global markets.

Russia's stagflation presents a complex landscape for investors, characterized by both risks and opportunities. Sectors such as energy, defense, agriculture, and renewable energy are likely to experience positive impacts due to increased demand, higher commodity prices, and global shifts in energy policy. Companies within these sectors are positioned to capitalize on market gaps and heightened geopolitical tensions.

On the other hand, industries heavily reliant on Russian imports, facing supply chain disruptions, or contending with rising input costs may encounter significant challenges. Aerospace, automotive, consumer goods, and certain technology companies may see reduced profitability and operational difficulties.

For investors, a strategic approach involves focusing on sectors and companies poised for growth amid these global changes. Allocating resources to positively impacted ETFs can offer diversified exposure to these opportunities. However, it's essential to remain vigilant, as the situation is fluid, and geopolitical developments can rapidly influence market dynamics. Continuous monitoring and a willingness to adapt investment strategies are crucial in navigating the complexities arising from Russia's economic conditions.

Investors should conduct their own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.

**TL;DR**: Russia’s potential stagflation could disrupt global markets, especially in energy, metals, and agriculture. Sectors likely to benefit include energy (e.g., Cheniere Energy), renewable energy (e.g., First Solar), defense (e.g., Northrop Grumman), agriculture (e.g., Mosaic), and metals (e.g., Alcoa). Sectors that may suffer include automotive (e.g., Ford), aerospace (e.g., Boeing), technology (e.g., Intel), and consumer goods (e.g., PepsiCo) due to supply chain disruptions and rising commodity prices.",0,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fr0abv/what_the_impending_stagflation_in_russia_might/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

For example someone goes all in on AAPL Calls, makes $100,000 in one day with a risky 0DTE Bet, Then the very next week gambles and loses all of the $100,000 in AAPL Calls.

Apparently the loss was a wash sale, and those can't be used to reduce taxable gains, the loss is not eliminated but deferred.

So what if he actually waited the whole 31 days then he lost it all, would he not owe any taxes then? I'm kinda confused by this wash sale rule.",2,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fons5w/what_exactly_should_we_do_after_a_big_yolo_gain/

1flki7o,1726860877.0,Portfolio Review of a Teenage Investor; how am I looking?,"Hey y'all, I recently began my investment journey about 3 months ago and I'm looing for some insight into my current allocations across my entire investment portfolio.

For some background, I consider myself a pretty disciplined and long-term focused investor, and I am willing to accept a moderate amount of risk. I dedicate about 90% of my income (\~$2100/month) towards savings goals and investments as I have a paid off car, no debt, \~$200 bills/month, and I have a fully funded a 12 month emergency fund.

Roth IRA:

* Total Market Index (FZROX) - 70%
* International Index (FTIHX) - 23%
* US Bond Index (FXNAX) - 1%
* Bitcoin Index (FBTC) - 6%

Traditional 401(k):

* S&P 500 Index (VIIIX) - 100%

Traditional IRA (rollover):

* Total Market Index (SWTSX) - 70%
* International Index (SWISX) - 30%

HSA:

* Total Market Index (FZROX) - 70%
* International Index (FTIHX) - 30%

Taxable Account(s):

* Total Market Index (VTI/SCHB) - 9.85%
* International Index (VXUS) - 6.5%
* S&P 500 Index (VOO/SPLG) - 21.7%
* Nasdaq 100 Index (QQQM) - 7.15%
* Individual Equities (MSFT, AAPL, BRKB, JPM, AMZN, etc.) - 54.8%

% of Total Portfolio:

* Roth IRA: 52.4%
* Traditional 401(k): 8.7%
* HSA: 2.2%
* Traditional IRA: 1.5%
* Taxable Account(s): 35.2%

I obviously understand the risks associated with my \~3% position in FBTC as well as my \~15% position in stocks across my accounts, I'm certain that I'd like to get my crypto position to around 1-2% and my stocks to around 5% over the next 6 months. Apart from that, I do have a few questions regarding my portfolio:

1. Would it be beneficial to wait until LTCG takes effect next year and sell my individual equities in order to rebalance into my index funds or bite the bullet and just sell them off now?
2. Should I concentrate all of my bond allocation inside of my 401(k) to leave more room in my IRA for index funds? Should I have bonds at all?
3. Should I revert back to my original investment strategy within my 401(k) of the Vanguard 2070 TDF, or remain with my S&P 500 Index?
4. Should I reduce my 12 month emergency fund into a 6 month emergency fund and lump-sum the difference in order to rebalance?
5. Should I just go 100% VOO in my taxable account? 50%/50% VOO/VTI? Do I need to diversify with International within this account?
6. Should I cut back on my savings/investments and focus more on myself/education?

I will be doing some rebalancing on Jan 1st and around Tax Day, so any input is appreciated on how I should move things around. Thanks for any and all advice!",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1flki7o/portfolio_review_of_a_teenage_investor_how_am_i/

1fjsgpa,1726665116.0,What ETF/Stock should I have?,"Well, I am Brazilian and use a bank that still do not offer Treasury and Bonds for investing, also, we cannot access all Fixed Income ETFs at the moment. I have no will of moving away from this bank, so the question is:

I am planning of investing up to US$ 5000,00, I already got around US$ 300,00 invested, varying among:

Fixed Income ETF: SGOV

Stocks: AAPL, AMZN, BRK.B

ETFs: DIV, SDIV (both for dividends), IVV, VOO, VTI.

  
I'm not worried about oscillating the value of those US$ 300,00, but I am about the new US$ 5000,00. If we could already invest in treasury bonds I would do so. Anyways, so what would you invest in to have the least negative oscillation possible?

I was thinking about a big part in SGOV, then split a little between VOO, VTI and IVV, what do you think?

Imagine that you are very poor at market timing, and always bought at the market top in the last 10 years. In the last 10 years (Sep 2014 - Sep 2024), there were 358 all time highs for SPY, and you bought $100 worth of SPY at every all time high prices of SPY. Guess what, in 10 years your total investment is $35,800, and your current portfolio value is \~$73,000, total return of >100% in 10 years. This calculation does not include \~2% of annual dividend. So, based on the rule of 72, annual average return is \~9% even if you bought at the market top. I expect the next 10 years will produce the similar results.

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Monday morning as investors await the Federal Reserve’s highly anticipated policy meeting, during which central bankers are expected to cut rates for the first time since 2020.
*****
> S&P 500 futures slipped less than 0.4%, while futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104 points, or 0.2%. Meanwhile, Nasdaq-100 futures pulled back 0.3%.
*****
> Apple shares fell more than 2% in early trading after analysts at firms, including Bank of America and JPMorgan, noted that shipping times could point to lighter demand for iPhone 16 Pro models than the prior year.
*****
> The S&P 500 is less than 1% away from its July record and could notch a new all-time high this week. After a rough start to a historically weak September, the three major U.S. indexes ended last week’s trading session in the green, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite just closing their best week of 2024.
*****
> The Fed is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday and are widely anticipated to make their first interest rate cut since they began hiking rates in March 2022. A cut this week would be a pivotal move, as many investors hope the decision could lower borrowing costs for companies and improve overall earnings growth — boosting economic growth.
*****
> The overnight lending rate is currently at 5.25% to 5.5%. Traders are split on whether the central bank will cut rates by 25 or 50 basis points, per the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
> Stocks typically post strong gains during cycles where initial rate cuts are able to sustain economic expansion, BMO Capital chief investment strategist Brian Belski said.
*****
> “So long as nothing breaks in the economy, U.S. stocks remain firmly within a bull market, but with significantly strong trailing one-year performance headed into this initial rate cut, future gains are likely to be more muted relative to historical norms, in our view,” he said in a Friday note ahead.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as September sluggishness continues, traders await inflation data: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were mostly flat Tuesday after the major averages rebounded from their worst week in 2024.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each added about 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 16 points, or less than 0.1%.
*****
> Cloud platform company Oracle surged about 8% after posting fiscal first-quarter results that topped expectations. Oracle also announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to provide database services.
*****
> On Monday, the three major averages made a sharp comeback after posting their worst week this year as investors bought the dip. The S&P 500 popped 1.16% to snap a four-day run of losses and post its first winning day in September. The Nasdaq Composite also closed 1.16% higher, aided by a jump in Nvidia. The Dow climbed 484 points, or 1.2%.
*****
> These moves come as investors bet that a widely anticipated interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve’s Sept. 17-18 meeting could help assuage concerns over a weakening economy. August’s payrolls report, which came out last Friday, reflected growth of 142,000, below economists’ expectations. The results helped fuel a sell-off that day.
*****
> Traders have their eyes on two key economic reports that will likely be the next catalysts for stocks. The consumer price index report for August is due out Wednesday, followed by the producer price index on Thursday.
*****
> September is historically a weak month for equities. Investors remain cautious about seasonality’s effect on stock performance as well as uncertainty around the approaching U.S. presidential election on Nov. 5.
*****
> “We concur with the view that the market is likely to remain choppy at least until the election,” Bank of America equity and quantitative strategist Ohsung Kwon wrote Monday. “Macro data have been weakening, especially in manufacturing/goods, which represent 50% of earnings for the S&P 500.”

1fc881s,1725829352.0,The AAPL Monday Morning arbitrage trade (codename 7senshino's arbitrage),"Update:  a user reminded me it's not an arbitrage, I agree with him. However I'm not able to update the post title, so I'm putting this update on the front here 

I'm sharing this old idea I had more than a decade ago. I bought AAPL around 2012. Then for several years, I would look daily at it's stock price. One day i noticed that if I bought AAPL at 9am ET on Monday morning then sell at 9.30am ET, I could possibly make a profit, at least on days where the market would not be doom and gloomy.
Doing it daily and compounding the profits, I'd end up possibly rich, at least based on a quick calculation I did in either 2014 or 2015  with a subset of data ranging forabout a quarter length...

That's it, easy right, little risk, hence a possible arbitrage:
Buy AAPL at 9 on Monday, sell it at 9.30.

But I never executed the idea as I didn't want to get into the active trading thing.
Fast forward now in 2024, I'm wondering if it  was a great idea?
I don't have access to my Bloomberg anymore and don't have time to run numbers. Maybe it's an old well known idea among traders and I'm not the first one who thought about it. 
Maybe it's still a valid trade, maybe there are other stocks who would enjoy the Monday morning effect or kick.
I have no idea.
But I wanted to share it here to all the experts to get some insights.
Feel free to use it if you can make a buck out of it. If you become rich and reach the moon, don't forget me :).
Cheers.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1f8spne,1725454841.0,[Reuters Exclusive] Intel manufacturing business suffers setback as Broadcom tests disappoint,"Sept 4 (Reuters) - Intel's (INTC.O), contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O), failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.

The tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.

Reuters could not determine the current relationship between Broadcom and Intel or whether Broadcom had decided to walk away from a potential manufacturing deal.

""Intel 18A is powered on, healthy and yielding well, and we remain fully on track to begin high volume manufacturing next year,"" an Intel spokesperson said in a statement. ""There is a great deal of interest in Intel 18A across the industry but, as a matter of policy, we do not comment on specific customer conversations.""

A Broadcom spokesperson said the company is ""evaluating the product and service offerings of Intel Foundry and have not concluded that evaluation.""

Intel's contract manufacturing business was launched in 2021 as a key part of Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger's turnaround strategy.

Broadcom is not a household name but makes crucial networking gear and radio chips that helped generate $28 billion in overall chip sales in its last fiscal year. It has benefited from the boom in spending on artificial intelligence hardware, and J.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur estimated it will bank $11 billion to $12 billion from AI this year, up from $4 billion last year.

Some of its chip sales are from agreements with companies such as Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), Google and Meta Platforms (META.O), to help produce in-house AI processors, which can include arrangements with a manufacturer, such as Intel or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (2330.TW),.

**CRUCIAL SETBACK**

As part of a disastrous second-quarter earnings report that shaved more than a quarter from the company's market value, Intel announced a 15% job cut and a reduction in capital spending related to its factory construction. Gelsinger and other executives will present a plan to the board of directors in mid-September on possible cuts to business units and teams to reduce costs, Reuters reported on Sunday.

Intel has committed to about $100 billion of expansion and new factory construction at several sites in the U.S. A crucial part of the company's expansion includes attracting big customers such as Nvidia (NVDA.O), or Apple (AAPL.O), to fill up capacity at all its new sites.

Intel reported a $7 billion operating loss for the foundry business, wider than the $5.2 billion in losses the year earlier. Executives expect the contract chip business to achieve breakeven in 2027.

Typically fabricating an advanced chip requires more than 1,000 separate steps inside a chip factory, or fab, and takes roughly three months to complete. Production success is determined by the number of working chips on each silicon wafer. Achieving a substantial yield is crucial to move to producing the tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of wafers demanded by big chip designers.

Broadcom's engineers had concerns with the viability of the process, the sources said. Typically that refers to the number of defects on each wafer or the quality of the chips fabricated.

For an advanced manufacturing process used by TSMC, the Taiwanese giant charges roughly $23,000 per wafer at high volume, according to two sources familiar with wafer pricing. Reuters could not determine Intel's wafer pricing.

TSMC declined to comment on its wafer pricing.

Moving a chip design from a manufacturing process used by a company such as TSMC to another vendor such as Samsung (005930.KS), or Intel can take months and requires dozens of engineers, depending on the complexity of the chip and the differences in manufacturing technology.

Betting on a new manufacturing process such as Intel's 18A is impossible for some smaller chip companies because doing so would require resources they do not have.

Intel released its manufacturing tool kit for its 18A process to other chipmakers over the summer, Gelsinger said on an earnings call last month.

The company plans to be ""manufacturing-ready"" by the end of this year for its own chips and begin high volume production for external customers in 2025, Gelsinger said. At an investor conference last week, he said there are a dozen customers ""actively engaged"" with the tool kit.

1f8aj9a,1725395623.0,AAPL vs. NVDA Comps,"I consider AAPL a good reference point for NVDA considering there aren’t many companies with market caps so high.

For the last quarter, AAPL’s revenue was **85.78B** compared to **30.04B** for NVDA. But of course their margins are different - AAPL’s is close to **25%**, while NVDA’s is close to **50%**. That’s how we get net income in the last quarter of **21.45B** for AAPL and **16.6B** for NVDA. All else equal then, NVDA’s value should be about 77.39% of AAPL’s. Looking at today’s market caps we have AAPL at **3.383T** and NVDA at **2.649T**, which puts NVDA’s value at 78.30% of AAPL’s, or roughly 1.3% overvalued based on net income alone. 

But of course all else is not equal. As you know, a company’s valuation is based upon future earnings, not past. When we look at the past quarter, we see that AAPL’s net income **declined 9.26%** from the previous quarter, while NVDA’s **increased by 11.56**%. Even if Apr-Jun is typically a low quarter for AAPL, looking at year over year change in net income, shows us **7.88%** growth for AAPL compared to **168.24%** for NVDA.

Why then does NVDA have only a one percent premium over AAPL based upon net income, when NVDA’s net income grew 46.7% more in the past quarter than AAPL’s did in the past year?

One more thing: I haven’t accounted for after-hours action, so NVDA’s slight premium over AAPL based upon net income alone is probably gone now.

1f4c5lt,1724962159.0,"NVDA will hit 5T market cap in 2026, and 10T market cap before 2032.","Hi regards,

This is not a ""copium"" post about the recent stock price drops.

I am a 3rd world country regard who is a Software Engineer and I will share my insights into the industry with my broken ass English, if you want to join me on this journey, be my guest.

The problem with NVDA is that they are ""overhyped"" not ""overpriced"". Some of you regards might say that ""OH THEIR STOCK PRICE INCREASED 150% YOY HOW IS THAT NOT OVERPRICED"", I will kindly ask you to check their income growth, which sits at 122% YOY.

First of all, lets compare some other tech giants earnings to NVDA earnings to see what they are ""worth now"".

|Name|Stock price|EPS|SP/EPS ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|AAPL|230|1,4|164|
|MSFT|413|2,95|140|
|AMD|145|0,16|1.035|
|META|516|5,16|100|
|AMZN|171|1,26|135|
|NVDA|116|0,68|170|

As you can see above, they are not overpriced related to their current earnings. And I think that them going back to 110 will set them good for later improvements. But them getting hyped beyond recognition was the sole reason for them being priced at 130 per price.

But before jumping into the NVDA analysis, lets go over every single tech stock in that list.

## AAPL

Latest thing they achieved was M1 chip, converting old and worthless Macbook Pro hardware into a performing machine with great battery life. This was also accompanied by the fact that they can charge a premium for small hardware upgrades (200$ for a simple 256GB storage?), which helped them to sell new computers to their old customers and gain huge profits.

How do I know this? Because after 2021, when M1 chip proved to be powerful and resourceful, most of our Macbook stack got renewed. I was using a 6 years old work Macbook before that, because newer Intel Macbooks did not promise anything new.

But this was 3 years ago. Now, they are pretty much failing to create new income markets. Their latest tech demo ""Vision Pro"" failed miserably. Their only means to increase their income is to sell more hardware to push their services (AppStore and stuff), but this is also under investigation and they probably will have to open up their ecosystem more.

## MSFT

They did suck tits before Nadella became a CEO. They tried to be a ""everything"" company but everything they did suck. Then Nadella came and transformed the rotting corpse of MSFT on the Golden Throne into the Cloud giant they are.

They are platformless. Their services are used everywhere. They are bringing Windows into ARM devices (again) and it does not suck this time. New ARM platform seems to outperform M series Macbooks in battery performance, which will end years of Macbook supremacy.

They are agile. They set and integrate trends easier. Game Pass? Azure? Cloud Office?

## AMD

I am a fellow AMD user (7900XTX gang?) and oh boy they are at least a few years behind in datacenter solutions. Also given their driver problem history on Desktop, power draw problems and other bugs, they need more resources to fix their problems first.

Also, sadly, they do not have CUDA. Personally, I am training some neural networks on my 7900XTX and it is 5 to 10 times faster than my CPU but also 5 to 10 times slower than NVDA counterpart. And also, I have to put in the extra work to find that specific framework that works with AMD and make the very specific adjustments before even I can start using the hardware.

Even if their hardware can match NVDA, it is like having a really fast fighter jet without any software assistance, yeah you can MAYBE safely take off if you work hard enough, but you will never win against the jest with a strong software.

And no one is buying their data center products (Other than their CPU's). I will get on this in NVDA's section.

## META

They are a ""AD"" company, just like Google. They have some ""long game"" products (Metaverse and Google Self Driving as much as you joke them), but they are far from ALPHA phase. If they can show the world that this is the future, they might get a 60% to 90% increase in their value.

ALSO THEY ARE BUYING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF WORTH NVDA PRODUCTS.

## AMZN

The ""everything company"". They are big. But not as much profitable as the rest. For me, their biggest product is AWS. If they can create a new income source they will be the next 3T company, may be even earlier than GOOGL.

# NVDA

AND OUR STAR CHILD.
HOT TOPIC OF 2024.
THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD.

Do you remember when they wanted to acquire ARM? This was back in 2020, when their market cap was around 145 BILLION. Do you know how much they were willing to spend on ARM? 40 BILLION DOLLARS. This was before the AI craze and boom in their revenue.

So why did NVDA wanted to acquire ARM? For their CPU's of course. They are going to create the Apple way of Datacenters. Soft spot of H100 series was their lack of integration between CPU and GPU. Blackwell aims to solve this. Finally, they are creating a whole SOC, with their new CPU, Grace.

Remember what I told you in AAPL's section? The way their tight integration of M series chips with rest of the system made their profits skyrocket? Do you see what will Blackwell do for NVDA now?

H100 users will have a clear path to upgrade, and with their newest technology, they will get MORE OF THE PIE on the single server rack. If NVDA made X thousand dollars of profits from a single server rack from H100 users, this will definitely go beyond 4X mark with Blackwell.

And I previously mentioned no one was buying AMD. This was because in our company, we have bought A MILLION DOLLARS worth of NVDA datacenter products. There was a discussion in our team, if we should buy AMD datacenter GPU's because it was WAY cheaper, I mean 4-5 times cheaper. Everyone disagreed and we went with the NVDA GPU and AMD CPU, and we are just one team in a huge company.

Remember when I told you I was a THIRD WORLD REGARD? Yeah. NVDA technologies are just spreading to this part of the world. Even we are spending MILLIONS of dollars for NVDA. And we are just starting to build up our NVDA datacenters. What do you think in 5 years, when it is time to upgrade, do you think that we will switch our provider and ditch all the work? Or do you think that we will go with NVDA and make them rich?

Let the bears win some battles, so NVDA can win the war.

1f3krxk,1724880051.0,How do you do a proper research on a company?,"I am trying to level up my game, and for a pretty long time I just looked at the balance sheet, a few ratios, P/E, forward P/E, compared these to the industry average, healthy cash flow, debt etc. Most of the time I just did this on well known stocks, MSFT, AAPL, NVDA, INTC, AMD, META etc. basically companies you hear about a lot everywhere, I just had no trust in lesser known companies to outperform the market, even if these basic metrics were promising.

Now it worked out relatively well since I started investing, but I feel like I didn't really beat the market by too much with my stock picks given the extra risk I took. There was a study by [Cornell](https://www.cornell-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-Q2-Memo.pdf?_bhlid=91b22f94067500de4f838bfb72c6cdab059cf3dc), where one of the graphs show the % of SP500 stocks beating the SP500, and while the data doesn't go back too much -would love to see one that goes back until 1970-1980 at least-. however for the 2014-2023 period it can be seen that about 40-50% of the companies beat the 'market'. So basically if you stock pick with a random generator you have a good chance to have a similar performance to the market. So I believe with a proper educated research it would be possible to tip the scales in our favor.

So I feel like the way I picked stocks was sort of look at the most hyped and known companies, have a basic glance on some ratios and the balance sheet, and I feel like this is so bad that it will bite back after a while. I see quite a few people here on reddit and some other communities knowing so much about a company, the moat they have, why it's a good investment, why it would be a bad one etc. What is the proper approach to get information? What sources are valuable? I assume earning reports are one, but I doubt they have all the information of the industry the company is in, why it's better than competitors etc. surely there are some other sources that are used for all this.

(Part 1)","I believe the story of the last 20 years of stock market is that one tech startup can disrupt an entire sector and join the tech giant club. For many sectors, information is king and turns out a company with a few 1000 people who have studied the science of information can outperform millions of people who aren't so scientifically rigorous. Now some sectors are not so prone to be disrupted by these information science experts. And if you asked me 20 years ago which sectors will be disrupted in what order, I would've guessed wrong.

$AMZN Turns out the value of millions of retail stores across the west was not in their inventory, their brand or their location. Amazon proved their value was in knowing who wants what item when and where. Information. How can millions of retail shop compete with amazon when they already have my payment information (how) my location (where) and all amazon has to figure out is what do I want, which I'm happy to tell them by typing one word or expression in a search bar instead of walking around Home Depot trying to find a employee who's not too busy and has every reason to avoid me. Sentences and social interactions just can't compete with 1s and 0s. Now I wish I figured this all out 20 years ago when amazon still a great investment opportunity, but how could I have known Jeff would overcome all the hurdles by building this impossible network of warehouses and delivery. I won't make the same mistake twice.

$NFLX (movies). $SPOT (music) $GOOG,$META(ads, communication, media), $AAPL, $MSFT etc... These are 100% information sectors that I would've guessed would be disrupted. But these were winner takes all. How could I know Facebook wouldn't fail like MySpace and Friendster? That iphones would be better than blackberry and nokia? How could I know Yahoo would become a total failure when they had such a commanding lead in the early internet era. These stocks will keep going up but they're not the 100 baggers they once were.

And so in true wsb fashion, the question becomes, what tech startup is poised to do the same thing to their respective sector. Let's assume no company can be worth over $5T in the next 10 years. We need a company worth less than $50B whose sector is still ripe for the taking, and whose in the business of information. A sector whose legal hurdles have kept the incumbents safe from the efficiency of tech startups. A sector who created legal barriers that could resist a decade longer than taxi drivers could resist $Uber, or hotels vs $ABNB.

There are 3 answers : Finance, defense and gambling. These sectors have the highest barrier to entry of any. Their regulatory agencies are basically just a revolving door between government and industry. They are the most regulated sectors out there but they are finally starting to crack. Crony capitalism only works for so long.

From a pure computer science perspective, overtaking these sectors is not technical challenge, in the same way Unity is failing at becoming the universal game engine. There's no legal barrier to become a game engine. Activison, Take two interactive, Ubisoft, etc.. everyone wants $U to succeed but they're now years behind on their promised revolutionary Data oriented technology stack. Everyone wants $TSLA Full self driving to succeed, but they're years behind Musk's first promises of success by what? 2017?. But those are technically hard challenges, maybe impossible with current hardware limitations. Now if you want to bet on their success, good luck to you but I'm not interested in those investments. Only someone at the cutting-edge of those technologies can make well-informed decisions. Only someone at the cutting-edge of semi conducters could've guessed $NVDA would obliterate intel and amd. I won't pretend to have any such knowledge about the future as I make these observations about the past. This is not what this tech investment thesis is about.

And so in conclusion, three stocks stand out in their positioning and the state of their respective industry :

If you are under 40 years old, $HOOD (Finance), $PLTR (Defense) and $DKNG (gambling) will 100x during your investment horizon. Part 2 tomorrow as I dive deeper on all 3.",2,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f2x0d1/the_next_tech_giant_why_hood_pltr_and_dkng_are/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1ey5xy1,1724287255.0,The Millenial 40 (MILF) List,"Today I produce to you the Millenial 40 List a.k.a MILF. These are 40 stocks that Stacy's mom might not have heard of, but our millenial buddies use these products and services all the time. This is a serious list.

To start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum.

Our millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their ""Information Worker"" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.

They buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)

They spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.

They drive a TSLA or RIVN.

They're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.

They're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice ""subs"".

They use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.

They're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.

To get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.

They check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.

They often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.

When they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.

When they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.

After they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.

They are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct ""business"" for their ""coaching classes"" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).

Whatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.

At the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.

And of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",134,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ey5xy1/the_millenial_40_milf_list/
1ey1gi0,1724275437.0,Next Steps with Rebalance and Growth,"I posted a couple weeks ago seeking some advice on a 3 fund portfolio and bonds [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1elrna2/3_fund_portfolio_bond_advice/).  Got lots of great feedback, and now that I have digested it all - I'm looking to move on some of it and hoping for some followup great advice on how to best handle.  The gist of it was:

  
*$5M portfolio, heavily weighted in AAPL and TSLA (80%) with $1M cash. Commenters suggest diversifying into index funds or bond funds, considering the tax implications of selling stocks, and caution against over-reliance on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios due to its high cash allocation. Some recommend exploring municipal bonds for tax efficiency and using a more conservative investment strategy given my financial situation.*

What I've started the process of doing is moving some of the cash to VOO, VXUS and VXF at a 50/25/25 split.  I feel confident with that mix and my goal of turning this $5M into $10M in \~10 years seems possible.  That just leaves the stocks and figuring out how to best convert those over into the 3 funds.  Am I right in assuming that there is really no real trick to this other than to sale them at the rate of taxes I'm willing to incur each year?  Much of the AAPL and TSLA holdings are profit so they are gonna hit me the hardest.  If I'm right in that assumption - what not just pull the bandaid off and do them all now?  Is there any real benefit to doing them over several years?  I don't plan on selling everything, but do want to move the bulk of stuff to those 3 funds.",1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ey1gi0/next_steps_with_rebalance_and_growth/

I plan to invest 5% in ASTS because I believe that their technology is the future.

1exbvsb,1724200496.0,Big tech stock price vs market cap ,"So I was thinking about where big tech stock prices can go from here considering 7 stocks account for a significant portion of the US market already. It’s hard to comprehend a company that is already 7% of the total market, consistently beating the market over the long run. 

Then it hit me; With share buy backs, assuming these companies are buying back more shares than they’re paying out in comp every year (which it looks like they are), the stock prices of the major big tech companies should increase by a higher amount than their market caps do. 

A quick Google search reveals that AAPLs outstanding shares decreased 2.9% in 2022 and around similar amount in 2021. This basically a “guaranteed” 2% of annual growth on the existing shares not taking into account other factors that affect stock price?

Is there anywhere I can see a graph of a company’s market cap like you can do with stock price? I’d like to compare share price growth to market cap growth.

Long term play:

While US stock market been on a run past few years, HSI is down 40% since 2021. Now that we see signs of inflation coming down we will see a big sell off in tech stocks as soon as we get the rate cut. Smart money will try to lock in long term CDs and rotate to value, things that happened to LULU/SBUX/NKE will happen to most of the tech stocks. 

we already seen examples of it (Buffet cut AAPL, Ackman bought NKE, Burry added BABA) therefore I think now is a good time to go long BABA.

  
Short term play:

BABA is about to do something called Stock Connect. I had no idea what it was so did a search on it.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-hong-kong-listed-shares-093000723.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alibabas-hong-kong-listed-shares-093000723.html)

Basically investors from Mainland China can invest in BABA through Stock Connect if approved by September 9. Up to $12 billion might flow into BABA from Mainland China. You know they will front run this like they did with Bitcoin ETF. There might be a short term play here to make some money.

1es01n4,1723637688.0,GOOG - Bull Case - Custom TPU leading to successful AI products,"I've been experimenting text based GPT from OpenAI's ChatGPT to Google Bard to now Gemini AI.

Since late '22 when the world was caught in attention on the magic of ChatGPT, people have been flocking to buy the next best accelerator cards (Nvidia), hoping they can be the next one to come out with the killer app - that ambitious goal to reach AGI first.

It's only up until very recently that I was made known that Gemini AI is entirely trained on Google custom TPU. I read a little about it (I found that TPU discussion is very little over here) and found that in the earlier days since Alexnet deep learning approach back to 2012.

Previous generalized computing (thank you Intel Xeon) tries to cope with big data workload. Accelerators were found to be particularly efficient in those machine learning workload. Early exploration by Google on designing custom TPU for themselves so they can have more flexibility catering to specific workloads. This decision alone turns out to be very valuable in today's Gen AI era.

With recent news from Apple that they have been training their AI models with Google's TPU, also the performance of Gemini AI to be on par with industry leading ChatGPT (heard that Antropic's Sonnet is even better - but Gemini is really good enough for my daily use).

These observations make strong statements to the Gen AI community, i.e.,  you can bypass Nvidia and still perform adequately well (even supercede for some reports) in your AI product offering.

The fact that Google does not hoard all its computing power to its own Gemini training, and the ability to extend its compute to customers like AAPL speak volume on the native TPU effectiveness.

Cost and time wise, Google is the prime candidate in AI era as TPU helps smoothen out the training cost. With ads revenue fueling the AI training (heard that OpenAI now needs more money), and superior TPU working natively, I'm of the opinion that Google will create a lot of value many years from now.",56,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1es01n4/goog_bull_case_custom_tpu_leading_to_successful/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

So like a proper regard I tanked it over the next month to 39k. Great progress so far. Then slowly started following a technical analyst, and making some plays. Had 67k in the account last Friday, and then made 123k Monday through today. 96 came from AAPL puts I bought Friday and held into the weekend, and the rest from AAPL and QQQ puts today.

1ems9hz,1723077403.0,The Worst Start of August Since January 2016,"JP Morgan economist Bruce Kasman commented that aside from maintaining a 45% chance of a recession in the U.S. next year, he has also raised the likelihood of the U.S. economy entering a recession by the end of this year to 35%! This probability is higher than the 25% at the beginning of July, mainly due to various data indicating that the demand for labor is weakening more severely than expected, with initial signs of layoffs already appearing!

JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon also stated that a U.S. recession is the most likely scenario, with the chance of a soft landing being between 35% and 40%! Multiple economists have expressed their views, casting doubt over the economic rebound and causing U.S. stocks to open high but close low last night.

👉 The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points, and the S&P 500 index dropped by about 0.8%! The cumulative losses for both in the first five trading days of August mark the worst start since January 2016!

1elrna2,1722974628.0,3 Fund Portfolio / Bond Advice,"I'm 44 years old and have about $5M in my Schwab accounts. Around $1M is in SNAXX money market, taking advantage of the high interest rates, and the rest is in stocks and mutual funds. My largest holdings are in AAPL and TSLA, accounting for about $3M.

I spoke with my adviser at Schwab today because I'm ready to redirect my monthly SIMPLE IRA contributions (\~$2666/month for my wife and me) from buying stocks to something else. He suggested the Schwab Intelligent Portfolio, which seems like a good fit. I've also been reading about the 3-fund portfolio.

So, with all that in mind, I have a few questions:

1. **Feedback on SIP vs. 3-fund portfolio?** If I go with the 3-fund portfolio, should I stick with the Schwab options listed on the Bogleheads wiki, or is there a better way to choose the funds?
2. **Advice on moving $500K from SNAXX to bonds:** I'm ready to move half of the $1M in SNAXX to bonds in preparation for interest rates coming down, so I can lock in some good returns for the next 5 years. Any recommendations on what I should consider buying?

1el42sg,1722904543.0,How Terrifying is the Start of August?,"Just over the past three trading days, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 indices have all recorded their largest three-day cumulative decline since June 2022! Last night, the Nasdaq plummeted by over 6% at one point, and the S&P 500 dropped by more than 4%, with both indices returning to their early May levels by the close of trading.

Although the major U.S. indices and individual stocks still closed with significant losses, the intraday declines were somewhat moderated. The primary reason for this was the release of the U.S. July ISM Non-Manufacturing Index, which rebounded from a four-year low in June to 51.4, exceeding market expectations and returning to the expansion zone above 50!

Sub-indices, including the New Orders Index and Employment Index, also showed growth. Notably, the Employment Index reached 51.1, marking the largest increase since September of last year and the first time this year that it has entered the expansion zone above 50. This data slightly alleviated fears from last week's significant non-farm payroll decline, making the market believe that the drop in new jobs was primarily due to Hurricane Barry hitting Texas.

👉 As discussed previously, the sharp decline in U.S. stocks at the start of August stemmed from worries about the U.S. economy falling into recession. Therefore, when the ISM Non-Manufacturing number showed growth yesterday, it somewhat restored market confidence in the economy, helping to narrow the intraday losses of U.S. stocks. The U.S. stock market now needs to see positive economic growth news to recover, unlike before when everyone was hoping for bad news, anticipating a Federal Reserve interest rate cut!

Hence, it is crucial to continue monitoring other economic data. If strong and robust growth numbers do not consistently appear, investors will remain concerned about an economic recession, and the trend of selling stocks for cash will not end. The VIX Fear Index is a crucial indicator to observe market sentiment calming down. It surged above 55 in early trading, a level not seen since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020!

1ehr1f1,1722544422.0,"Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump","Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  

Here’s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: 

EPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated
 
Revenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated 

iPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated 

Mac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated 

iPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated 

Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated 

Services revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated 

Gross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated 

Apple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  

Apple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  

Apple’s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company’s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  

“On a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that’s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,” Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach.  

Cook said that while Apple doesn’t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  

“What we’ve done is we’ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,” Cook said. “From a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners’ financials, and we would be paying expense.” 

“Certainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we’re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,” Cook continued.  

Apple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. 

Cook said that about half of iPad buyers haven’t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. 

Apple’s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  

Apple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under “Wearables, Home, and Accessories.” Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  

“A whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we’re still growing that base significantly,” Cook said.  

The Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company’s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple’s forecast and LSEG estimates. 

Apple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple’s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  

Apple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple’s App Store.  

However, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  

“Mainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,” Cook said. “Kantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.” 

Apple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.

1ehnm3r,1722536026.0,Analyzing the Analysts: Using average analyst price target to identify buying opportunities amongst the top 100 companies in the S&P,"Hello everyone,

I'm a lazy investor and don't like to do much due diligence, but I do like to make money. Unfortunately these two things about me are often at odds as I've lost money in the past for not doing my DD. As such, I continue to be lazy but I try and find ways to work around doing due diligence and hopefully finding loop holes.

One such way that I have been thinking about recently is using analyst ratings, reviews and price targets as a surrogate for due diligence. In essence, I try to just have these analysts do the work for me. The idea is that much in the same way that with those who believe in technical analysis hold that everything you need to know about a stock is baked into it's price action, and so when something good happens the stock price goes up and when something bad happens the stock price goes down, thus all you need is to analyze trends in stock price and you'll be analyzing everything about the stock by proxy, I have a thesis (or theory) that perhaps you can do the same or something similar with analyst price targets of companies.

Now I know that anyone who has read this far already thinks I'm an idiot. Many experienced individual investors probably find market analysts to be stupid and therefore I'm stupid for following their lead, but I would argue to the contrary for a few reasons. As much as I have put in a lot of effort to learn about how the market operates (been investing for the last 6 years, started learning actively about it as much as I could a couple years prior to that), there is still much I don't know as I don't have a finance or economics degree. Moreover, as bad as you may think an analyst is, they are at least competent enough to keep their job as an analyst at the investment firm that allows them to make stock price target selections. Lastly, and most importantly, what I am about to discuss below uses the aggregate of numerous analyst price targets so I'm not relying on a single analyst, but several (probably between 10 and 40 per company). I think if two-dozen analysts are strongly in favor of a company, it is unlikely that my novice investor wisdom would have researched the company and found a flaw that they all missed.

So what I did yesterday evening was go through the top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap and find the current average price target for them on Yahoo Finance. I then divided the current stock price (at the close on 7/31) by that price target and expressed it as a percentage to see how far off the company was from the average price target analysts were aiming for. Then I also listed how many total ratings each company had, and how many of them were 'Strong Buys' and 'Buys'.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
**Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)**

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Based on this table above, I tried to identify some companies that met a few criteria. I wanted to identify companies that had at least 25% of their analyst ratings be 'Strong Buys', to have at least 20 analyst ratings available and for the current stock price to be at 90% or less of the average price target. This lead me to the following 11 companies:
Micron Technologies (MU), Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbot Laboratories (ABT), Merck Scientific (MRK), Stryker (SYK), The Cigna Group (CI), Broadcom (AVGO), Comcast (CMCSA), Honeywell International (HON), Analogue Devices (ADI), and Intuit Inc. (INTU)

I have about $5,000 I'd like to invest right now and I have half a mind to just put it equally weighted into these 11 companies and just watch it for the next year or two. I'll either do that or put it all in VOO, but I have a feeling that these 11 companies might beat the S&P 500 over the next 24 months.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1e5k8n6,1721228147.0,Would an All In Fund that only ever held the single largest stock have beaten global indices?,"One of the arguments for investing in the S&P 500 is that it's cheaper (in the UK, net of tax) than global index funds, like the FTSE All-World. And you get most of the same risk-return profile, because the US stock market is the largest market.

What if that logic was extended further?

Imagine a fund that only ever held one stock. The stock that had the largest market cap weighting in the (publicly listed) investment universe. It only ever traded (1) when the #1 stock changed, and (2) to reinvest dividends. Very few trades reduces holding costs to a minimum.

Today, the all in fund would hold 100% AAPL.

5 years ago, it held 100% MSFT.

In 1990, it held 100% XOM.

[https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/](https://www.finhacker.cz/top-20-sp-500-companies-by-market-cap/)

Would the fund have a better return than, say, the FTSE All-World, or the S&P 500? I expect the standard deviation to be (a lot) higher, but which would risk return ratios - Sortino, Martin, ... - favour?

UPDATE

My thanks to [these commenters](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e5k8n6/comment/ldnyi7b/). Price return for the All In Index is easy to calculate. For the period 1990 - 2024 I get 12% PR annualized. Compared to 8% PR for the S&P 500.

The current beta for AAPL is 1.24. The Sharpe ratio is thus > 20% better.

My intuition for this question came from the statistical idea of representation. If there are any fund managers reading this, my DMs are always open.",85,64,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1e5k8n6/would_an_all_in_fund_that_only_ever_held_the/
1e5ds72,1721208050.0,Am I missing something?,"I was researching the difference between total outstanding shares vs float, and apparently most companies do not exclude instituional shares from float because they are traded on exchanges as well. My example is Apple, which despite having 57.59% institutionally owned shares its float is 15.31b of its 15.33b shares. What I don’t understand, however, is how it says 5.22% of shares are owned by insiders, which I thought was not included in public float calculation. However the float is 99.8%, not 94.78% or whatever; so clearly at least the vast majority of these shares are counted. Is it only certain restricted shares that are not counted? Also the only article I could really find on this on titan.com said some companies calculate institutional shares as part of public float, some don’t. Are there any examples of some that don’t? Thanks in advance.

1e3wgti,1721054460.0,Active IRA management vs index funds and ETFs?,"I’m curious to know where people stand on whether they think they should place their own trades in IRA accounts vs buying index funds and etfs. I’m on the side of active only because I know what I’m doing especially during high volatility when I’m able to pick up stocks at lower prices during or after selloffs. This concentrated buying has allowed me to see pretty big upside when the stock rebounds especially if it rises more than the index. The risks of this is that SPY/QQQ has been rising consistently. I have been really conservative about buying tech thinking the market will pull back and I have missed out big as a result. My YTD would be around 30-40% if I didn’t sell my positions early but that’s life. 

Me (Roth IRA): 19.35% YTD

Nasdaq 100: 20.83% YTD

My biggest winners include

-RKLB. 37.92%. $4.05. I think this is a 5-10 year play. I buy on dips. I’m too afraid to sell covered calls on this for fear of the price running without me.

-Arm bought near 52 week low and sold around $80 thinking it was overvalued… I bought back with a small stake at $120 begrudgingly only to see it rise to $170.

-hood. Bought at $8, sold for $9.50…. Thought it would keep ping ponging. Bought back at $20 and will average down if need be but the company is not going out of business

-rivn. Up 35% YTD, my biggest position. I bought slightly high but kept averaging down. I actually believe in the company. Cost basis $12.94.

-aapl. Up 20% YTD. I have a small stake because I kept waiting for Apple to drop to $130 before rising to $200 which did not happen. Cost basis $195.

-Bcrx. Up 58% YTD. I’ve known this bio company for almost a decade now. They ping pong so it’s mostly cyclical. $4.65 cost basis 

-cava. Up 26% YTD. Kicking myself for not buying more. 

-SG. Bought at like $9, sold at like $13. Kicking myself. I bought after reading about their subscription service and seeing how people are paying $20 for their orders

-FBTC. Up 16.98%. Cost basis $47.14. Bitcoin is here to stay like it or not. Wish I didn’t penny pinch when trying to buy 100 shares of MSTR 2 years ago for $500. 

-HUM. +19.52%, $323.75. Healthcare is expensive and this company is not going out of business so I buy dips.

-KWEB. +17.52%, $23.90. China will rebound, well at least Chinese tech. 

-Lmnd. +25.08%, $16.16. Saw a report on their business model and it gives headaches but can work if they survive the growing pains. I think they are here to stay and will probably get to $60 in the next 5 years.

-Meta. +19.29%, $420. I actually bought Meta at $115 during the crazy but got spooked when it dropped below $110, I sold for a profit but kicked myself for not holding. I believe in the company and they are just getting started revenue wise in my opinion. So many AI plays here. Regretting not having the cash to load up this time around. 

-NFTY. +15.23%. $53.77. India will probably keep growing. This stock also pays a good dividend. 

-RBRK. +13.75. $30.83. Cybersecurity is growing. I also have positive numbers in Palo Alto which I buy on earnings drops

-snap. +42.52%. $11.33. Snap is not going out of business. The stock drops after earnings so I just buy then and wait for a rebound. It’s one of my largest holdings. Wish I dumped more cash and wish it would drop when the market drops but it’s held firm the last few months

-Z. +23.83%. $40.83. Bought during the sell off when the courts ruled against the industry. Zillow will be fine. 


I actually don’t have many losers. The stakes are small.

-Aal. -14.41%. $12.54. I think it will bounce back in a year or two. 

-CGC. -15.33%. $7.52. I don’t know much about weed but figured I’d buy a small stake just in case.

-MSOS. -14.19%. $8.70. Small stakes in weed, lottery ticket

-WBD. -15.88%. $8.66. The worst buy I’ve made. Figured might as well keep it.

-Snow. -13.67%. $154.53. I knew I was buying high with snowflake but didn’t expect the big drop. The stake is not big. I still do believe in the company.

-Dis. -9.94%. $107.54. Knew I was buying high, my fault really. Thankfully not a big position and Disney will bounce back.

-Hubs. -17.29%. $570.91. Tiny stake. I actually like the current price and will buy around $420.

-CMG. -7.08%. $61.36. Knew I was buying high but long term hold.

-PZZA. -7.84%. $45.74. One of my larger stakes. Papa John’s is at a 4-5 year low which is crazy to me since their numbers are not bad. It’s a cyclical play if you look at the chart. Plus the company is not going out of business. Worst case scenario is this drops to high $20s which do don’t know how that can even happen. I’ll keep buying weekly.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1dynck3,1720480790.0,Interested in thoughts on five to ten year retirement plan,"I am in my early 50s - and starting to look at retirement down the road here.  

If you had a sizable amount (we could use $1 million for this purpose) right now and were looking to retire in 5-10 years what do your investments look like?  I kind of have mine grouped in a low/medium/high segmentation and trying to figure out which I feel most comfortable with.  Interested in your thoughts on the three below but also on what you would be thinking in that same timeframe.

**High Risk - Heavy on bitcoin ETF**

This one is interesting as a lot of bitcoin optimists predict bitcoin to hit 100k - 150k by end of 2025.  I am not sure I would hang on to this strategy long term but instead wait to see if it can get over 100k and cash out and then go down to more of a Medium Risk - if I went this route.

**Medium Risk - Tech Heavy with some ETFs**

Heavy with some of the big tech like AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, AMD, etc.... along with some funds like SPY, QQQ and SCHD.  This one feels like it could go very well in the next 5-10 years if tech and AI continue to be the forefront of the conversation.  It's still not really that diversified but feels like it could maximize returns on the happy path.

**Low Risk - Retirement centric 2030 or 2035 target funds** 

Almost completely fund based where the investments could be spread amongst a few funds that are 2030 or 2035 target retirement funds and would have the requisite risk associated with retiring in the near term.",1,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dynck3/interested_in_thoughts_on_five_to_ten_year/
1dyltw8,1720476894.0,"MSFT and AAPL are overvalued and overbought, Wallstreet is expecting too much from AI. ","I got to try Microsoft's copilot this week and i have to say i was underwhelmed by what it had to offer. It just felt like an enhancement for windows with more features, nothing ground breaking. This wasn't a major leap in technology like going from fax's to email. Tech companies releasing new (free)upgrades and new (free)products is like Nike releasing a new pair of shoes, just something else to add to the lineup. Will it make SOME peoples jobs more efficient, yes. Is it applicable for most people, i have to say no. Nike makes shoes for athletes but maybe 1-2% actually use them for what its intended for. Lets say a company has 20,000 employees, of those employees how many need it for their role or will using it on a daily basis? Maybe 90 % wont. If that's accurate a company will only pay for the 10% that need a user license.

If chat GPT was never released all the mag 7 earnings would still be about the same without it.

Now for the overvalued and overbought. MSFT has a PE of 40, one of the highest of all the mag 7. Your paying $40 for every dollar they earn. Based on their current AI stack im not sure they will be able to beat the current expectations in a big way consistently. MSFT is not NVDA. NVDA chips cost $30k+ each, as much as a low end Tesla. Copilot has a free version and the pro version is $20-$30 per user. Most people at companies are not using this and im not sure this will add to the bottom line very much. That means most of the earnings growth will have to come from the cloud business, admittedly the cloud business has been growing at double digits for a long time but there is also a lot of competition in cloud space, at some point growth will slow as cap ex spending slows. The other thing to consider is what AI costs for these companies. The GPU's are expensive, Data storage is expensive and the energy demand from AI use is very very expensive. At some point AI use, especially from free users is going to eat into the profit margins.

MSFT right now is like buying a over priced Cadillac, yeah it drives nice but its overpriced.

AAPL is also overvalued at 35x earnings. Adding chatGPT to a smartphone and enhancing siri isn't worth the current valuation. The goggles were a bust. No new products on the horizon just same stuff just newer versions. Apple isn't the glamorous high growth tech company it once was. Iphones sales are falling off in China and this will definitely show in the next couple quarters of earnings. Its the Nike of tech stocks. People aren't spending $100 for shoes they certainly wont spend $900+ for a phone. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffet starts to offload shares at this PE ratio.

That fourth industrial revolution is not happening today or tomorrow, we are too early. This is going to take some time.

I agree with Ken Griffin on this, the current AI products on the market are not the revolution many are hoping for, they're mediocre at best. There's too much spending and too much free products for this to add to any company's bottom line. The real winners are semi's, data storage and anything surrounding it.

1dto192,1719932653.0,"Only interrupt compounding, unless it's absolutely necessary.","So I hope you are all doing fine with your portfolios. I checked my YTD performance due to mid-year. I am up 21% (30th June) vs the S&P's about 14%. I just realized something I never really thought of before, because I was not a huge seller so far. My performance would have been much better without taking tax hits from selling stocks.

I am from Europe, tax hit is about 26% on all gains above 1000€(annually) when selling. I mean, I knew it before, but I just realized it this year, as my tax hits are 4 figures now. I do understand more and more why Warren B. says “If you aren't thinking about owning a stock for ten years, don't even think about owning it for ten minutes.” The most important part is really to not interrupt compounding.

Take for example AAPL. €10k invested in AAPL in January would be +17% €11.7k. You would have beaten the market when holding. If you sell: €1.7k gains 26% taxed left about €11.25k left. You would be up only up about 11% and been beaten by the index after selling. Index-funds have the big advantage, that they get taxed only at the very end, that way you don't interrupt compounding.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1dpbvd3,1719441893.0,Safe starting plan to get into Futures? As well as what to do with my ROTH? ,"Hello all, I am very confused on how to proceed from the position I am in, and so would really really appreciate some advice. I am 19 years old.

Firstly, for some background, I started trading maybe back in 2022, I put in about $2500 in a WeBull trading account and invested in a bunch of big names like AAPL, TSLA, LMT, etc. And I invested some money into some complete no name stocks that I saw on TikTok. By what I would imagine to be completely luck, these stocks actually did quite well and they have been in the green for some time now. But yes, I know not to take advice from TikTok lol.

Fast forward to now, I havent touched the account since then, and opening it I have made a return of about 16% with about $400 in total open P&L. Which I feel like is good? maybe? I don't know.

Anyways the reason I'm making this post is because I'm interested in short term profits, I have always wanted to get into options but to be honest it just seemed very tricky and like gambling, and so it's always been a ""I'll learn how to get into it later"", but a few days ago I heard about something called futures trading and it seems much more simple and I would like to get into it. I have a very superficial understanding of how it works, and so I was just hoping to ask a couple questions about it:

1. Should I trade futures through a prop firm? Especially if I am just starting out/don't have a trading strategy? Or would I be better off starting with micros & my own money?
2. On that note, how do I go about developing a trade strategy? Do I just watch a YT video on different strategies available and pick one? My friend told me all strategies will work if I just use discretion but tbh that just made me more confused lol
3. What should I use to trade futures? I have heard that Ninjatrader is good.

And the next topic comes to my Roth IRA through Fidelity. over the course of a few months back in 2022 I put $200 in it monthly and eventually stopped, mainly because I was confused what ETFs I should put my money in.

People have told me VOO > SPY, but then some others said $FXAIX > $VOO. Which, if any, is true? Should I invest in all 3? Also, is $200 a month enough? Should I aim to max for $6500 contributed annually? Does it really matter?

I realize this post is all over the place and I apologize, but it's all the more reason I would appreciate some answers and so that I know where to go moving forward. Thank you very much!!!!",9,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1dpbvd3/safe_starting_plan_to_get_into_futures_as_well_as/

1di3gxc,1718644573.0,"Nvidia to get 20% weighting and billions in investor demand, while Apple demoted in major tech fund","KEY POINTS

* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.
* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.
* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.



[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).

The index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.

All three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.

As a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.

That is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.

  
The race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.

The XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.

The big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.

“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.

The fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.

The free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.

“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.

The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.

On Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.

[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/) briefly passed [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/) in market cap on Wednesday during intraday trading as the chipmaker emerges as the primary beneficiary of the [artificial intelligence](https://www.cnbc.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/) boom. If it holds until the close, it will be the second most valuable U.S. company.

Nvidia hit a [$3 trillion market cap](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html) milestone during intraday trading. Nvidia had a market value of $3.007 trillion at one point, versus Apple’s, which stood at $3.005 trillion.

Nvidia shares have risen over 24% since the company [reported first-quarter earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2025-.html) in May and have been on a tear since last year. The company has an estimated 80% market share in AI chips for data centers, on which big tech companies spend billions.

Investors are also becoming more comfortable that Nvidia’s huge growth in sales to a handful of cloud companies can persist. For the most recent quarter, its data center business, which includes its GPU sales, rose 427% in a year to $22.6 billion in sales, about 86% of the company’s overall revenue.

Meanwhile, Apple shares are only about 5% this year, as Apple’s sales growth has stalled in recent months. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, Apple said overall sales dropped 4% and iPhone sales fell 10% from the year-ago period. Apple faces strategic questions and issues about demand in China, manufacturing, and mixed reactions to its new virtual reality headset, Vision Pro.

Apple was the first company to reach $1 trillion and $2 trillion market caps. It has frequently been the most valuable U.S. company over the past few years but was again [passed by Microsoft](https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-overtakes-apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-2024-01-11/) earlier this year. Microsoft has benefitted from the same investor demand for AI as Nvidia.

Nvidia’s stock has been more volatile than Apple. Founded in 1991, it was primarily a gaming company, selling hardware to play 3D computer games. More recently it has sold cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud subscription services.

Nvidia shares have gone parabolic as its AI business has developed, rising over 3,290% in the past five years.

1cloc2h,1715015349.0,Reducing exposure and simplifying porfolio,"So I’ll preface this post by saying younger me was not the smartest long-term investor. Older me is trying to reconcile with that.

Younger me didn’t know much about investing and bought individual stocks which thankfully have yielded a considerable net positive.

As I learned about ETFs/index funds/bonds/etc. over the years my investing budget went toward those and I stopped retail investing altogether. I left the individual stocks alone because they were overall very profitable and most were companies that are big names and not super volatile. However, those stocks still make up a little over 50% of overall investments.

Fast forward to current me where I’m looking at the portfolio and seeing stuff like VTI *and* AAPL + GOOGL (just an example, but there’s similar instances like that). It’s redundant at best and increases exposure at worst.

Selling off the individual stocks (all long positions) will yield a sizable capital gain which I’m not thrilled about, though I know simplifying is ultimately the right/safest thing if I still have a ways to go until retirement.

For those who have lessons learned over time, what’s the best way to approach this problem? (Gradual selloffs across tax years, mass selloffs, leave them alone, etc.)

TL; DR - Simplest way to exit my single stock positions when I’m not allowed to trade due to my job.

**Context:** I recently took a new job at a large professional services firm, and as part of my contract I am no longer allowed to trade single-name stocks. There are no exceptions. However I’m still allowed to buy/sell ETFs and other funds.

**The problem:** I have a Fidelity personal brokerage account through my last company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Between jobs I was diversifying by selling my old company’s stock and putting it into ETFs and a handful of single name tech stocks like AAPL. However I was not aware of the new company’s policy (my fault, I know) and now I’m stuck in a place where about half the value of the account is still in that one stock and the other half is split between various funds and small positions in other stocks.

**What I want:** To exit all of my single stock positions and put that money into funds following a Boglehead-like strategy. I don’t want active management.

Can I hire an advisor from Fidelity or Schwab to “take over” my account and liquidate it? Or would that be considered me directing the investments, which is not allowed?

1bxutbz,1712461680.0,Request for advice on portfolio diversification,"I've hung onto a sizeable chunk of AAPL for 15 years, snagged back in 2008 at the opportune moment. For all that time, I never felt the urge to venture into other investments until the recent buzz surrounding AI. Like everyone else, I was wowed by NVDA's stellar performance, just as AAPL seemed to hit a plateau and face some challenges.  
As a result, I offloaded half of my AAPL in November for NVDA. Come January, I found myself questioning why I hadn't just sold the whole lot, especially considering that one's growth trajectory was bound to outshine the other in the same timeframe. However, by then, NVDA had already nearly doubled. This prompted me to scrutinize the market more closely, leading to selling off the remaining half of my AAPL and diversifying my portfolio.  
Today, here's where I stand:  
\- 61% NVDA  
\- 11% SMTC  
\- 9% MSFT  
\- 6% ORCL

\- 3% MRVL  
\- 2.5% AMD

First off, I'm keen to hear your take on this mix of investments. Secondly, I'm pondering why I opted for seven different stocks instead of going all-in on NVDA, much like I did with AAPL in 2008. Let's be clear: I chose these stocks because I believe they offer reasonable profit prospects over a 3 to 5-year window for the entire portfolio. However, I'm still convinced that within a one-year timeframe, NVDA is likely to outperform the rest.  
Bottom line: Did I make the sensible move by diversifying across different stocks, or does my gut feeling that I should focus on the big player hold merit?",5,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1bxutbz/request_for_advice_on_portfolio_diversification/

19fgbu1,1706207813.0,One common mistake of a novice trader,"Let's imagine the mindset of beginners. Beginners want to earn quickly, a lot and with minimal effort. And most likely, we know from our experience, they will be quite fearful. So they will choose those instruments that are well-known and have a good reputation. These will probably be stocks of companies such as Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple.

**How will beginners add companies to their portfolio?**  
Let's specify that the stocks of these companies are not cheap and cost 100-300 dollars. Of course beginners want to fill their portfolio on enthusiasm right now. This means our trader will go to the stock exchange and simply buy them.  
**What is wrong with that?**  
The point is that you should buy shares of even the seemingly coolest and most famous companies not at any moment of time when you want to, but look at whether it is a good time to enter a position.  
**What does good or bad timing mean?**  
In investing for 10-15 years the concepts of good and bad time lose their relevance. Because for such a long period of time stocks can fall and rise 100 times.  But if we speak about from 1 to 6 months trading, it is very important to choose the right moment. Because you need to earn money rather quickly and you want to earn more, of course.  
For the sake of simplicity let's consider 2 companies: META and AAPL.   
Both of them have a beautiful growing chart for the last year of trading, but you should not buy both companies now, if you take them for a short term.  
The fact is that META and AAPL stocks are at their all-time highs right now. They have rallied strongly over the past couple months and there will soon be a period when the price will be corrected. Since there is no one chart in the market that is a forever rising straight line. There will always come moments of correction. And if you buy their stocks now, you are very likely to buy at the most expensive price in recent times.  
That's why it's important to learn how to analyze charts and choose the moments to buy or sell smartly.",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/19fgbu1/one_common_mistake_of_a_novice_trader/

197uv9e,1705382169.0,Offsetting Previous Losses While Continuing to Invest for the Future,"Hello, I am looking for some advice on smart investment strategies to offset my previous $100k loss against my recent capital gains for tax purposes.  
  
In 2020 and 2021, I made some poor decisions by getting involved in risky options trading without fully understanding the downsides. Over time, I ended up losing around $100,000 from these trades (short-term). It was completely due to my own ignorance and mistakes. After 2021, I realized option trading was not appropriate for me, so I stopped all forms of trading to focus on my career. Over the next six months, I worked hard to improve my skillset for better career opportunities and landed a well-paying job with potential growth prospects. In early 2023, I invested $70k into NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, and AAPL stocks. Fortunately, that $70,000 investment is now worth around $112k. I also received $17k worth of vested RSUs from my current employer which is now worth around $20k.  
  
Additional Info:

* Married couple (36M, 32F) with a 3-year-old child, living in California (rented).
* Combined household income is \~$420k ($370k base salary + $50k RSUs).
* Retirement Savings: 401k - $300k; Taxable Investments - $120k; Vested RSUs - $20k + $55k (spouse)
* 529 College Savings Plan - $7k, contribute $3k per year.

Previous Capital Losses:

* In last 2 years, deducted $6k capital losses on tax returns.
* Have $94k remaining capital losses carried forward per 2022 tax filing.

Questions:

1. If I sell my NVDA, NFLX, GOOGL, AAPL shares with $42k ($112k-$70k) capital gains, the gains would be offset by my carried forward losses from previous years and I would not owe any taxes on it. The remaining $52k ($94k-$42k) losses could still be carried forward. Is this understanding, correct?
2. Does it make sense to realize the $42k short term capital gains to offset against losses, even though normally I'd owe taxes on short term gains?
3. Is it advisable to sell my vested RSUs, realizing $3k capital gains, to also offset against my carried forward capital losses? This would leave me with $49k ($52k-$3k) losses still.
4. Would the gains from my $300k Fidelity T-bills (maturing Mar/Apr 2024) also be eligible to offset against capital losses? If not, should I buy more T-bills after maturity? Context - I plan to use this for a house purchase downpayment in mid-2025.
5. For short term savings goals (1-1.5 years), are T-bills the optimal way to get guaranteed returns? Given my losses, are there better alternatives with comparable returns I should consider?
6. I'm unsure how investments like VUSXX, SGOV, BIL, USFR, TFLO compared to T-Bills in Fidelity. Could I purchase these instead for short term savings goals? Would these help recover my losses faster?
7. I know my losses carry forward each year deducting $3k in taxes until fully utilized. Without offsetting gains, it would take 31+ years at $3k/year ($94k/3k). If there is any advice on any other ways to recover these losses faster, kindly feel free to suggest.",2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/197uv9e/offsetting_previous_losses_while_continuing_to/

I don’t think anyone gives a shit about Apple downgrades anymore.

Was getting excited that I’ll pick up more shares on discount, but looks like it’s not going below $180. 

Are any other stocks currently ignoring being downgraded? Are analysts losing their credibility with their constant hit or miss predictions?

191rf66,1704736916.0,Rebalancing Portfolio Suggestions,"I decided to really start investing about a decade ago. I opened a Roth IRA and have fully funded it every year. I contribute 5% of my check to a 403(b) that is matched at 10%. I had no credit card debt. I have an emergency fund (HYSA). Car is paid for. Small amount left on a 15 year fixed house loan at around 3%. I put $8,400 into a ""catch up"" Roth 403(b) a year.  

Seven years ago I had some money to invest that I could afford to lose, so I put it in APPL. This is now roughly 45% of my portfolio. This is too high and no longer in the realm of money I can afford to lose.  

I was thinking of selling some of the AAPL each year to finish out the Roth 403(b). I'm in my 50s so can contribute up to $30k a year. I make ~$70k a year.  

It would literally take me like ten or eleven years to sell all of my AAPL stock at this rate, but it seems like a great way to reduce my taxable income and to lock in some long term gains.  

I know the money I put into the Roth 403(b) will be locked up, but that seems fine by me.

18zycec,1704541609.0,Is it a mistake to go mostly cash now? Don't feel like much upside from here.,"I'm really getting close to going about 70% cash. Presently sitting at about 30%.

All my positions are mostly long and I pay 0% on my long capital gains.

Also, I have 10 years worth of contributions in my roth that I can sell with no tax.

I seriously don't feel like much upside from here 

Yeah, maybe I could make a few thousand before another major pullback in February and March, but what's the point?

I realize a lot don't sell due to taxes, but like I said, I don't have that worry so why should I hold and see my gains evaporate and then have no more significant cash to buy if we get some serious sales in February or March like I think we will?



I've been watching Mad Money and Cramer has been saying ""you should take some gains cause the big money won't start buying mag 7 till they sell off more""

I think that's true.

I.made really good gains in nvda. I bought in at $144 a year and a half ago and I'm up to $490 a share, but it's been topping at $495 or so and then staying in range.

I've also been heavy msft aapl googl asml and lrcx and have very significant gains.

Don't see any reason that any stocks are going to go higher in the next few months till at least April if that.

Sure, maybe oil and utilities and industrials will go slightly higher but I think big money is waiting for the mag 7s to fall.

Anyone else going heavy cash right now?

Yes I'm an investor, but you have to be smart and to me sitting in the market at a top is not really smart, especially if you can sell with no tax consequences.

18oksy0,1703267772.0,Roth IRA vs Cash vs Margin Accounts,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm trying to understand if my math (and logic) is correct when comparing gains on like-trades but in different account types. For reference, my investment amount will be $200,000 via TD Ameritrade/Charles Schwab, 15% tax rate, and 13.00% effective margin rate. 28 years old. Employed. Not married. No children.

&#x200B;

AAPL 2023 YTD performance is \~+55.25%. Past performance is not indicative of future results, I know. According to 1stock1, between 1981 and 2022, Apple has been positive 27 of those 42 years, with the strongest being +211.90% and the weakest being +5.42%. The average of the positive years is +67.8103704%. Apple has been negative 15 of those 42 years, with the worst being -71.06% and the least being -4.17%. The average of the negative years is -29.092%. 1995 to 1997 (3 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly losing streak. 2009 to 2014 (6 years) was Apple's longest consecutive yearly gain streak. The average of all 42 years is +33.202381%.

&#x200B;

Roth IRA contribution limit in 2024 is $7,000. Non-deductible. Tax-free at distribution in retirement. $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100

&#x200B;

Cash account of $7,000 + 30% = $9,100. Gain of $2,100 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $1,785

&#x200B;

I can see that in this example, the Roth IRA is the better choice as opposed to the cash account. However, the Roth IRA is limited to the $7,000 annual contribution. Any additional investing must be done in the cash account. As a result, the current optimal solution would be to contribute into the Roth IRA up to the limit and invest the remaining $193,000 in the cash account and continuing the annual contribution into the Roth IRA in following years.

&#x200B;

Margin account of $7,000 + $7,000 (margin) = $14,000. $14,000 + 30% = $18,200. Gain of $4,200 - 15% (tax) = Gain of $3,570 - my cost of margin for 1 year which is (.13 \* 7000) = Gain of $3,570 - $910 (margin) = Gain of $2,660.

&#x200B;

I can see that in this example, with the same $7,000, AFTER taxes AND cost of margin, the margin account is the better choice as opposed to both the cash account and the Roth IRA. Similar to the cash account, I have no annual contribution limit, can withdraw at any time, and can invest the full $200,000. With margin, this amount becomes $400,000. As a result, the current optimal solution appears to be investing the full amount of $200,000 + $200,000 in the margin account and disregarding the Roth IRA entirely.

&#x200B;

While I take much greater risks investing that amount in a margin account and having the knowledge/information that the average of Apple's yearly losses is \~-30%, over the long term, it's clear on paper that the optimal strategy is to go full margin, with the honest hope that the first 2-3 years are positive. I also expect my current effective margin rate of 13.00% to decrease as rates go down. I also expect my income to increase at a reasonable pace. I'm not sure if it's worth mentioning or not but I would like to marry and have children in the future.

&#x200B;

Again, is my math (and logic) correct? Am I completely overlooking something?

&#x200B;

Thanks!!

18bfk4u,1701792905.0,How to maximize Roth IRA contribution,"Hey everyone, I have a question regarding generating income to allow myself to contribute to my Roth IRA. For context I’m currently in graduate school and am no longer working. The past two years I’ve worked and been able to max out my Roth contributions while not making enough to be taxed when filing. I currently have ~35000 dollars in a brokerage account. I have made 808 taxable dollars in dividends and that is my only income for the year. I would like to try and contribute more than that. So I was wondering if it is possible (legal?) to sell all of my current long term investments that are positive then reinvest them. If I did this I would net ~5200 as income bumping me up to around 6000 to contribute to my Roth. Am I allowed to just sell my current gains and repurchase their positions, or does that form a sort of wash for tax purposes? If not could I potentially pivot to different holdings? If that is possible is there any other way I could generate the extra 500$ dollars of apparent income to max my contribution? Thanks in advance.

My thoughts 

\- Although competition is a concern, PayPal is still a solid brand name. Transactional volume still growing. 

\- The drop in user count YoY might not be a direct effect of increased competition, but pandemic online shopping has died down.

\- FCF is strong, buybacks & low forward PE.

\- Possible growth stories with Braintree, PayPal buy now pay later & Venmo.

\- New CEO focused on improving profit margins. 

\- High single digit growth

\-Decent network effects on both sides

17yaktc,1700326297.0,"7 years from $0 to $100k, 3 years from $100k to $200k","I joined eTrade in 2013 a few years after graduating college. I had set up automatic monthly contributions to my accounts, which I slowly raised over time and mostly invested in blue chip stocks. 

On December 1, 2020, the combined value of my Roth and Traditional Brokerage account was just over $100k. It took me over seven years to get there and was a major milestone.  In the past three years, I have raised my monthly contributions, continued to invest, and am now just shy of $200k at the age of 35. You read about the power of compound gains all the time, but to go from $100k to $200k in three years when the first $100k took seven years is a testiment to that fact.  My goal is $1 mil by 47 and eventually to hit $2.5 mil before I retire. 

For all you youngins out there, stick with it! But also, don't rush the process and try to hit home runs every day. For the most part, I am a buy and hold investor after a year or two of trying my hand at day trading with options and futures. When you chase the money, you won't make it. But if you’re patient with a decent risk tolerance, anything is possible. 



Edit: Wow, thanks for the up votes everyone. It’s been fun reading the comments. Adding some context here based on some of the questions that have come in. Monthly contributions are at $1,000 a month now, but in the early years they were less. When I first started, it was $100 a month and I worked my way up from there. There was a good chunk of time where they were between $200-$500 a month. These accounts were set up on my own, no employer match. I’m not sure what my lifetime performance is, but the last three years I’m up 30% overall. All that in mind, I can confidently say that well over half of my account is due to investment gains. 

Investments have been all individual stocks that I typically hold for a year or longer. I pick them based on both technical and fundamental factors. This is more risky than ETFs and index funds but it suits my investing style and risk tolerance. I try to stick to profitable companies with a stock price that has a history of moving in the right direction, however I also like to buy at a discount price. I keep my eyes on charts and when there’s opportunities to buy at historically undervalued prices I jump on it. There’s really nothing super special to it. Not going to share my current exact portfolio, but stocks I have owned in the past or currently include AAPL, GOOGL, META, COST, HD, MCD, DKNG, AMD, DIS, and BAC to name a few. There are many others I’m interested in buying that are on my watchlist.

I will also add that I’ve made a ton of mistakes along the way. Bad investments, selling too soon when I should of just held, taking risky, over leveraged day trades that resulted in nasty losses and wash sales. However, I’ve learned from them and never done anything bad enough that blew an account or resulted in a draw down that couldn’t be recovered. You can read all the books you want but I’ve always found that the best way is to learn by doing and over time you develop your own skills and are able to trust your own analysis and decisions.",1690,281,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17yaktc/7_years_from_0_to_100k_3_years_from_100k_to_200k/
17xwesd,1700275261.0,Difference between Purchasing Options on Different Brokerages,"Apart from the brokerage's own limitations and/or perks, is there a difference when you purchase options from one brokerage site compared to another? For instance, if I purchase AAPL call options on Robinhood compared to E-Trade or Ameritrade, will there be a difference in implied volatility, open interest, volume, and/or bid-ask spread? Or is it the same throughout the board as everything is connected to the greater stock exchange? ",0,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17xwesd/difference_between_purchasing_options_on/
