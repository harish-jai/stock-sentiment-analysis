1740269859.0,1ivx6rs,I've built an app to log daily P/L,"I started trading before Covid, took a break, and recently got back into day trading. One thing that always frustrated me was how most brokerage accounts don‚Äôt offer a way to see P/L in a calendar format for each trading session. So, I asked AI to help me build a simple web app called Flippl to:

* Log my daily profit/loss
* View trading sessions in a calendar or a chart
* Export all trade data to CSV for backup
* Generate a public link to share my all-time summary with others

Nothing fancy‚Äîjust an easy way to keep track of my trades without digging through spreadsheets.

Check it out here: [https://flippl.app/](https://flippl.app/)

Please feel free to use it, and I'd love to hear any feedback or suggestions!

1740269842.0,1ivx6k0,Very Red Friday = Green Monday | SPY Price Change Visualization,"https://preview.redd.it/869bjvs07ske1.png?width=3735&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d53cdee71232e7c7f8c034990553cea67aed595

I was playing around with some data on SPY from 2022 to present and figured out how to make a heat map in a calendar format based on the percent change from open to close. I didn't really see any major patterns in the data over that time period outside of what's already known - like, 2022 was volatile. 

However, I noticed that Monday's were generally more calm than all other days. And, although, some of the biggest red days in 2022 were Mondays, it still ended up being the 2nd best performing day of that year.

Fridays, on the other hand, are psychotic. Maybe its because people are trying to unwind all of their bad trades from the beginning of the week. I can't say, but the only thing this visualization does show about Friday's is that they can end up anywhere. It's like Monday's are the beginning of a wagging tail, and Friday's are the tip.

The one thing I did see that had a very strong probability was that very red Friday's (downward moves of 1.5% or more) seem to be followed by green Mondays. This does not take gaps into account. It's just based on ""closing price - opening price"". The data doesn't say ""buy at the end of the day on Friday"", but it does suggest that buying at Monday open after a -1.5% move, or greater, has, over the past few years had a great chance of being followed by a green Monday. 

If you see anything else, please share.

I'm starting to use the tradingview screener for my stock selection and I have a couple of doubts, specifically on the time interval.

If I use the time interval set to 1D, then the columns like ATR (14) and VOL (10) should be based on the last respective days.

However, If I add the Relative Volume at Time column, it should only work for 5mins bar according to:

What did they try to lure you back in once you had left, and were they successful at least once?

Were there any early signs that you are in for being robbed instead of doing the robbing early on? Why did you ignore these signs?

1740218189.0,1ivfflt,"I read almost every post here. I want to share. For a moment I felt like the best trader in the world. I was profitable for about 4 months and 40 trades. About %15 a week, daytrading, sometimes holding a position for 2 or 3 days at most.","Seeking ADVICE.   
I started trading about 5 years ago. I learned all the tricks and tips to being profitable very early on. No I didn't follow them. Following my methods I was profitable, but it is boring as shit and doesn't leave room for imagination. Through the years I've stumbled onto strategies that are profitable. I have 4 reliable and tested, and working on a 5th. Don't get me wrong, these are just simple set ups with little to no down side. The one that everyone knows, but it is not day trading, is just wheeling. You can make good money on that. But that's boring and tried and true for long term investors in stable stocks. The other ones seem complicated, but are simple, yet qualify as day trading, are very profitable yet never talked about. One of these gets me about 10% a month, and only requires me to make adjustments once or twice a week. A tad bit boring, but the money is nice. Then the one that I'd been testing last year, and I was scared to keep trying has been bold and it worked like a charm. 

I came up with this one on my own. I'm quite proud of it. I started with the goal of making 5% per trade. Ended up with wildly different results. About 1/4 of my trades ended up with 5-10% losses, which was definitely at times I shouldn't have been placing trades(like they all say). Other trades were wildly higher, since I dont have an upper limit of when I close, just when I feel like it is enough. I ended up making about 15% every week on average. I almost doubled my account every month for 4 months straight, while I also kept withdrawing some money and blowing it on nice things because that's what makes the sacrifice worth it. Recommend. 

Suddenly money was no object, and just like that money lost all value. The chaos of the 2 weeks of the pause in earnings and the chaos of January threw me off. I had days of randomly gambling on SPX (because I was trying to avoidwash sales, not trading on any of the regular names that I knew well, which i had traded in December), and after a few trades of making +10k, I just stopped thinking about my strategy. 

I no longer saw money as real, I didnt even care if I lost anymore, because I knew that I knew how to make it all back if I felt like it. Insane. I know you must be thinking that I was probably lucky and manic, which is all i could think too. But the funny thing is that I stopped putting money into the market last year because I became profitable. I don't need any of the money anymore. I realized that I literally was trying to get profitable so that I dont have to put any ""real"" money into the market anymore and not have to try to explain to my wife why I needed more. Now, I'm free. My wife has left me. Lol, jk. Now, i get to extract money and buy stuff for her. 

So where is the problem? Well, since I can't feel anything from the money anymore, I'm just throwing money into 0dte SPX options to see if I can catch the trend and day trade those options. Honestly, it's the fact that 1 word from 1 person can throw the market into turmoil any day, with the market being so fragile to headlines, I don't find my own strategies that profitable on a day to day basis. For instance, I can recover all my losses in a single trade, and I have multiple times this year-to-date alone. Today I just didnt even care, so I slept in and didnt trade; missed opportunity. 

So far, I have basically lost 50% of my profits from the point that i became profitable. But I guess I just look at it as just house money now. Also, this is the second time in the past 2 months that I have lost and made back and lost that same amount. So again... no lesson learned, so I'm still considering it daytrading but IDK.   
  
The thing is, how much money do I need to be happy? Not too much I think.   
Another thing that I realized was that I was worried about money, and I needed money to solve the problems of money. Which it did. But once I had all the money I needed, and money became meaningless, all the other real life problems became glaringly clear. I realized that the Money didn't give me extra time with my kids, and it didnt give me extra time with my wife, and it didnt even give me extra time because I was still trying to earn money. Honestly maybe im just depressed about the state of the world. I'm no fan of stress. 

So anyway...I guess i'm writing this because I have no one else (other than my wife who listens but doesnt understand what i'm doing or going through) to talk about this stuff. 

Sorry, I went off on a tangent. But I guess it is relevant to the advice that i'm seeking. I don't know what to do. I feel like I stumbled onto something that seems too good to be true, but has proven pretty real so far. I'm afraid of finding out that I was actually just a moron getting lucky every month, and that I should quit while I'm ahead. I tried to test it, using the 40 trades thing, and I feel like that gives it legitimacy. I don't know how much I can scale it, but I'm a small fish still. Should I just continue on with the trading even though I find it just so boring now. What really excited me was discovering and testing new methods and strategies. And that's why i'm always working on something new even though i have a few easy ones that already pretty much guarantee money. I have one that literally guarantees that i'll make money, but just takes a longer time frame. It did 5x over the course of about 5 months, and the win was guaranteed, but the amount wasnt. Anyway, I'm not sure if im allowed to make any statements without providing receipts, but I just need someone to understand what I'm going through, and maybe someone who has had a similar problem. I definitely have imposter syndrome. I also have a problem with doing the same mundane repetitive tasks, especially without co workers. I don't think people really realize how lonely it is without co workers. I wish I could have a nice normal desk job, but I have no skills. I could probably fill out excel sheets by hand, but AI is already doing that job now. I was thinking of going to work at a local coffee shop so I can have someone to talk to. 

P.S. Forgive me, I hope you will understand that I cannot share my methods. I am here for YOUR advice on daytrading lifestyle. The only advice I can give is that you should follow the advice that you see repeated on this sub over and over, the same 5 rules or something; i promise that if you are to ever become profitable, it will not be without following those rules.

1740196912.0,1iva282,Risk Management for my funded challenge,"I've been paper trading futures for a couple months, practicing with a $50,000 account. I have successfully ""passed"" TopStep's funded challenge (reach $53,000 without losing $2,000) a couple times and I'm gonna start the actual challenge next week. I wanted to share my risk management strategy here to hopefully get some feedback before I really go for this thing. 

I will be trading MES because it gives me more flexibility with my stop-loss and contract size. I risk about a half a percent per trade so that it takes 8 losing trades to hit the MLL of $2,000, versus 4 trades at 1%. Trading ES just makes it too risky I think because with those risk rules I can only trade 1 contract and have very limited range with my stop loss (I usually target highs/lows which can vary, not always fitting within 20 ticks). With MES, I can trade more contracts to be able to take partials and leave runners while staying well within my risk rules. I know this approach will take me longer to reach $3,000 profit, but it seems like the smarter thing to do because I have confidence in my strategy.

If I'm missing something glaring or you have any input please let me know, especially if you have experience passing these funded accounts. If this is good risk management, also let me know so I can let 'er rip. Thanks",1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iva282/risk_management_for_my_funded_challenge/

For those of you that are curious why the VX can be tied to overall market sentiment, it's because it is directly correlated to SPX options. A lot of the big dawgs in the market trade SPX options.

1740185300.0,1iv6pby,4 years in - looking for advice to fix my trading problems,"I started trading 4 years ago. The last 3 years full time. I am in financial situation where I don't need ""a salary"" to pay the bills so I've been able to focus on my trading (like a student at university or something like that). 

Here's a brief summary of my situation at this point:

1. My technical analysis is quite good  
2. My trading edge is clear and defined for me  
3. It took me a long time, but I know exactly what I have to do in order to do profitable trades.  
4. I know all the aspects of my strategy from the entry criterias to my ""trailling stop"" rules  
5. My BIGGEST problem is on the mental side, THAT is what's causing me to be unprofitable at this point.  
6. My drawdown is currently approx 5% of my account per month (used to be a much bigger number)

7. I only trade small size because I'm trying to prove myself profitable with small money before using big money. Therefore the drawdown isn't putting a huge strain on my finances (thank God)

To elaborate on #5 which is the cause of my problems:

I DO NOT have a ""calm/ultra disciplined"" personality. I'm a rather creative/analytical person (I'm a mixture of LEFT side + RIGHT side of the brain). I have trouble with being disciplined and not acting out of impulse sometimes. I have a tendancy to overtrade despite my being aware of the problem. I've got the hardest time doing the same thing day in, day out. I'm a rather intense person and I'm struggling with being calm/steady/repetitive

I know exactly what I have to do but its hard for me to reshape my psychology. Here's an example of my bad behaviour:

A) I tend to usually stay up until midnight and wake up around 6:30-7:00AM

B) I have trouble leaving my screens at times... meaning, I tend to want to ""trade everything"" and I have trouble being ""satisfied"" once I have made decent trades in the day.

C) It feels oddly counter intuitive and irrational, but I have a feeling my using small size is sometimes the reason I tend to keep trading. I can easily make 10-20r (risk to reward) in one day but give it back through overtrading. In other words: My using a 5-10$ per trade risk, means when I'm done trading in the morning, I'm up 10x to 20x 5$ to 10$... so in other words: 50$ to 100$ profit usually. And obviously, since the goal is to become a full time day trader, when my eyes see 50$-100$ they fail to see the big picture of (compounding gains/interest)

D) In terms of personality I have a really weird mix to deal with here because:

\- In life I'm generally not the ""boss"" at a given job, I'm usually the #2 guy. I'm not the very best at taking on as much initiative and responsibility as a ""boss"" does. I usually excel and outperform when placed under good leadership  
\- My near perfect balance between left/right side of the brain means I'm both creative and analytical. 

  
Conclusion: My personality is both my greatest strength and weakness. I always loved research and analysis in the past. I LOVE to teach myself stuff. I'm also ultra determined and do not ever give up until I get what I want. I'm usually LESS productive than other people because I spend the extra time required to figure things out, but that also means I sometimes waste time more compared to others.

Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to deal with my mental/personality flaws as a trader. If I could follow my rules better and avoid overtrading (trading after hours or too much in the afternoon) I'd be set. I'm also at this point where I'm really questionning what to change and what to do different.

  
I also manage my kids RESP and my own RRSP. Both these accounts are doing better than my margin account. It seems its easier to manage money you ""don't care about"" too much (or not emotionnaly affected). Its also possible at this point I just need to take a break to reset. When I say I spent 3 years full time, full time would be an understatement, I spent countless hours working/journaling/reviewing/refining my edge. 

TLDR: I spent a LOT of energy on ""technical analysis/refining my edge"" but my MUCH BIGGER problem to contend with is fixing my ""BEHAVIOUR"" problems/discipline.

Any advice and feedback would be much appreciated.

1740184099.0,1iv6ara,"How I Made $1,330 Shorting a 30-Minute Cycle High (Step-by-Step Breakdown)","One of the biggest struggles in trading is knowing what to do when you don‚Äôt have a clear bias. If you‚Äôve ever felt lost trying to figure out direction, this breakdown might help.

üìå My Approach When There‚Äôs No Bias

When I don‚Äôt have a directional bias, I rely on 30-minute cycle highs and lows as key POIs. These levels often act as natural turning points where price either rejects or breaks with conviction.

üìâ The Setup: Shorting a 30-Minute Cycle High

1Ô∏è‚É£ Identifying the POI:
	‚Ä¢	My key point of interest (POI) was a 30-minute cycle high.
	‚Ä¢	Price violated the high but then rejected with force.
	‚Ä¢	Confirmation: A Fair Value Gap (FVG) formed below the 30-minute cycle high, reinforcing resistance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Why This Was a High-Probability Short:
	‚Ä¢	I boxed the 30-minute cycle high to observe how price reacted.
	‚Ä¢	When price left the high aggressively, it confirmed weakness.
	‚Ä¢	Underneath the 30-minute cycle high, there was a 1-minute FVG, acting as a true support.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution:
	‚Ä¢	Price retested the 1-minute FVG inside my boxed area and held as resistance.
	‚Ä¢	As soon as price rejected and displaced lower, I entered a short position.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Management:
	‚Ä¢	When price left multiple FVGs behind, I secured my stop-loss at +$70 to eliminate risk.
	‚Ä¢	First take profit: 10 contracts were closed at the previous 30-minute cycle low.
	‚Ä¢	Final take profit: Remaining 10 contracts were closed at the 1-hour FVG.

üß† Key Takeaways
	‚Ä¢	When no bias, use cycle highs/lows for entries.
	‚Ä¢	FVGs at key levels act as strong confluence.
	‚Ä¢	Box your POI ‚Üí Watch how price reacts when it leaves the level.

# Celsius‚Äô $1.8B Bet on Alani Nu Sparks Short Squeeze¬†

Celsius just went all in on its energy drink empire, announcing a $1.8 billion acquisition of rival Alani Nu‚Äîand Wall Street is buzzing. The stock soared 35% Friday, its biggest jump since May 2020, sending short sellers scrambling with $250 million in paper losses. With 22% of Celsius‚Äô float shorted, the deal triggered a classic short squeeze, forcing bears to cover their bets as bullish momentum took over.

**A Shot of Growth or Cannibalization?**

Celsius‚Äô move is a response to slowing revenue growth, as competition from Red Bull, Monster, and newer entrants like Alani Nu eats into its market share. CEO John Fieldly argues the deal will create a $2 billion sales juggernaut, comparing Alani Nu‚Äôs growth trajectory to where Celsius was two years ago. But some analysts are skeptical‚Äîboth brands target the same young, health-conscious consumers, meaning they could end up cannibalizing each other rather than expanding the market.

**Pepsi, Distribution Wars, and a Defensive Play?**

Adding another layer of complexity, Celsius relies on PepsiCo for distribution, while Alani Nu partners with Anheuser-Busch. That means the two brands will be battling for shelf space, at least in the near term. Some analysts believe this deal may be more about playing defense than offense, with Celsius looking to secure its dominance before competitors squeeze it out further.

Even with this rally,¬†Celsius is still down over 50% from its 2024 highs, as its rapid expansion hit roadblocks. For now, investors are buying into the hype, but the real test comes down to execution.¬†If Celsius successfully integrates Alani Nu without eroding its own sales, it could cement its dominance in the fast-growing ‚Äúbetter-for-you‚Äù energy drink space.

But if brand overlap leads to self-cannibalization,¬†the deal could backfire, turning a short squeeze rally into another selloff.¬†Investors will be watching closely to see if this acquisition fuels sustainable growth‚Äîor just a temporary sugar high.

# Novo Ends Ozempic Shortage, Crushing the Copycats

Novo Nordisk just pulled the rug out from under the booming market for knockoff weight-loss drugs. The FDA declared the Ozempic and Wegovy shortage officially over, meaning compounding pharmacies‚Äîwho‚Äôve been cashing in on cheaper, unregulated versions‚Äîare about to lose their free pass. The news sent Novo‚Äôs stock up 5%, while Hims & Hers Health, a major seller of compounded semaglutide, tanked 26% as investors scrambled to assess its future.

**No More Loopholes for Knockoff GLP-1s**

With Novo finally producing enough supply, compounding pharmacies have 60 to 90 days before the FDA forces them to shut down production of identical copies. Some, like Hims & Sesame care, claim they‚Äôll tweak the formula to keep selling ""personalized"" versions, but the days of mass-produced, low-cost alternatives are numbered. Novo and Eli Lilly have long fought to get these off the market, arguing that compounded versions lack the same safety and quality controls as their FDA-approved drugs.

**Hims & Hers‚Äô Backup Plan: Make Its Own Drugs**

Hims & Hers saw the writing on the wall. Just hours before the FDA‚Äôs ruling, the telehealth company announced it bought a U.S.-based drug manufacturing plant, allowing it to develop its own versions of GLP-1 meds. CEO Andrew Dudum insists demand for customized obesity treatments will keep the business afloat, even if standard compounds get axed.

**Novo‚Äôs Big Bet on Weight-Loss Drugs Is Paying Off**

After spending $6.5 billion beefing up production, Novo can finally supply its blockbuster drugs at scale‚Äîjust as Eli Lilly ramps up competition in the $100 billion weight-loss drug market. But analysts warn that demand is still outpacing supply, meaning future shortages (and a lifeline for compounders) aren‚Äôt off the table just yet.

Once I've made the determination I open put credit spread if SPX is moving up, or a call credit spread if it is moving down. The strike of the write side of the spread is between $20 - $30 OTM. I close the position when my gain is 80% or when the loss is -40%. Thus far my P&L for this week is $4150.

1740179504.0,1iv4n87,Beginners: Focus on growing your intuition through consistency,"There's too much emphasis on trading strategies being the key to success. 

Real skill comes from recognizing subtle patterns that can‚Äôt always be written as strict rules.

While you might have a certain pattern that forms the basis of your entry signal, there are too many variables involved to succinctly describe one ""profitable day trading strategy"".

For example, your entry signal may be influenced by:
- Float size 
- Relative volume 
- Time of day 
- Preceding candle 
- Daily chart 
- Previous day/pre-market high 
- Moving averages 
- Recent news
- Market trend 
- Order flow 
- Short interest 
- Industry 
- Candle printing speed  

Intuition is rapid pattern recognition built from thousands of hours of trading.

Over time, you witness all of these variables interacting and eventually get a ""feel"" for optimal trades. 

As beginners, we should focus on being CONSISTENT - executing the same setups, reviewing trades, and building the chart time required to develop trading intuition.

Success comes from deeply understanding the context of each trade, not just memorizing a strategy. ",3,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iv4n87/beginners_focus_on_growing_your_intuition_through/

I do it in excel and track it with my trade data!  
So after enough data, I will be able to filter and get an even better idea of my stats too. That is just a side benefit though. 

The real power of this is making sure (with objective evidence) that my trades are good before I enter. I even color coded it too to give a clear picture with green = good. beige = neutral. and red = bad/avoid or seriously reconsider. This helps with friction and selectivity, making sure I am entering only the best ""pocket aces"" trades. It will give me more confidence to hold and help me be more objective / rational through the mechanical nature of answering these.

1740177396.0,1iv3u3b,How I became profitable,"I‚Äôve been trading on and off for about 6 years.
It took me 5 to become profitable not because I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, but because I blew up every account I ever had . At least 20 times

I had to take a step back and do some deep self reflection as to what was holding me back. I had excellent technical analysis , I was trading the same few instruments, I knew how they move like the back of my hand, I was an expert in trading platforms and how to use them, I knew everything I needed about contracts and what strike prices etc everything you name it I had it all checked off

The only thing I didn‚Äôt have checked off was following my rules religiously. I would constantly over trade , revenge trade, turn winners into losers, take just one more trade ( always turned into a few more trades) full port etc. I was an emotional trader

The moment I said and ACTED ON RULES

‚Äú I will follow my rules no matter what‚Äù 
‚Äú I will respect my daily max loss no matter what‚Äù 
‚Äú I will only trade within my appropriate position size no matter what‚Äù 
‚Äú I will only take my A+ set ups no matter what‚Äù 
‚Äú I will only take 1-3 trades no matter what‚Äù
‚Äú I will sign off after two small loses no matter what‚Äù 
‚Äú I will not remove my stop loss no matter what‚Äù 
‚Äú I will sign off after a good trade no matter what‚Äù 

Is when I had consistently profitable weeks .
Yes I had losing days , but I always recovered within a day or two and I avoided large loses 
Yes I didn‚Äôt make huge profits some days , but I added up wins to have winning weeks
Yes I wanted to make more money, but I remembered all the times I went green to red 

To any traders struggling but have a good system. The system is not what is holding you back, it‚Äôs your ability to let the system play out without making devastating mistakes.

You must re wire your mind to think in these ways and it WILL get you over that hump

Around 3:00, it started pulling back and I placed a limit order at $9.98. But after going down to about 9.90 or so, this shit dropped straight to around 8.25ish. I held onto it hoping it would go back up because it has been extremely volatile today and I do believe there was a solid chance of it going to where I could've at least broke even. But it kepd going down. I cashed out at $7.10 per share at around 3:45 and it closed at about $6.36. So after that trade, I walked away with about $30 profit today.

A couple of key insights;

* MACD is the single strongest indicator for this pair
* I need to be reviewing all trades at the 5m, 15m, 30m and 1hr time frames. 30 mins seems to be overall most reflective of short term trends
* I switched brokers from T212 to IC markets. On paper far better spreads and charges
* Ive qualified for a ‚Äòpro‚Äô level account (paperwork provided) to prove I move volumes and have a high net worth. This gives me up to 1k:1 leverage which is helpful, but probably won‚Äôt use, plus some more decent access to proper hedging protection, which Ill need to research

I only see a couple of not very popular options on TradingView and I don't think they're quite tracking it the same way. VOLD itself as a market internal shows massive numbers and isn't really giving me a ratio, do I take the UVOL and DVOL internals individually and divide the greater by the lesser to get the same ratio or are they looking at something else like VOLD divided by total volume ($TVOL)?  


I like the idea of setting alerts for a 3+ ratio among other factors like where $ADD is holding so that I might know when to either size up or extend my take profit strategy for that period, hoping for a greater follow-through, but I don't even know how they're getting this ratio and they don't explain it in the video.

My intention is to become a profitable trader, thats it. I have a job that pays well, but I want to learn the art of trading. I've been trading for about 4 months, and I have lost about 2500$. This is fine, I kind of knew I would lose money, and it was money I could afford to lose. Why did I do it if I knew I would lose the money? Well, my mindset when I started was that ""what if I can do this, and I end up paper trading and making good profit on paper, instead of real profit""? Yes, its a weird mindset to have. Anyway, I wanted to be honest so lets get to the point.

Everynow and then I see advice in here, that in order to become consistently profitable, one has to put in the **time** and find an **edge**/learn a **strategy** that works for **YOU.**

This I totally understand, and I've accepted that I will have to learn by paper trading, OR, trading 1 share at a time - otherwise I will probably blow up my account.

But what I find difficult is, when studying all the various strategies (reddit, youtube, books, etc.), how to filter out the ""bad ones""? Do I really need to start testing each strategy in a paper account for months and months to build a journal and see if it works or not, just to conclude ""nope, this is not profitable"", only to go to the next potentially bad one. Rinse and repeat.

Or, could we try to list down a few strategies that you, experienced day traders/scalpers, have learned to be profitable with? Maybe with a short explanation how it works, what is the edge, or information about where one can learn more about it? I think it would be easier to get started by having some direction.

  
Thanks, and sorry if this is the 1000th time this kind of question is posted!

1740156390.0,1iuvdc9,Beginner trading - making ¬£2400 my first month üéÄ,"Using ¬£2k, I have consistently traded every trading day, coming out on profit every day. My favourite to trade has been 3xPalantir - I have been using MACD on 1m/5m charts. 

I am a 26 year old girl, no background in finance - self taught. And I‚Äôm scared!!! I get in and out of the trades in probably less than 2 minutes. 

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of strategy discussions saying to stay away from only using MACD. 

What are the strategies that are great to use with MACD? Should I stay away from leverage (x3)?  I‚Äôve kept a trading diary by scribbling down my trades - is there a good platform you recommend using? Also, what are the best video resources you found?

(Be nice. I‚Äôm just trying to retire and generate enough income (I don‚Äôt need much) for my dad who is a hardworking tradie working 12 hour days with a brain injury and who‚Äôs had 6 brain operations in recent years. I just want to consistently make enough to tell him to stop. Hehe.)

Thanks guys :) x",1,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iuvdc9/beginner_trading_making_2400_my_first_month/

1740153051.0,1iuu16m,The Harsh Truth About Trading: Why Most Fail and Few Succeed,"I want to add my two cents about the high number of failed traders.

Let's say that your local hospital is short-staffed, and they decide to introduce a new offer to the public: you can come to the hospital and act as a doctor. Here‚Äôs how it would work: for every medical procedure that is administered properly, you would receive a great reward. The catch is, if you fail, you get sued and need to pay a fine.

You start watching YouTube videos on how to insert an IV, what medication to give patients, how to recognize certain diseases, and even how to perform surgeries. You firmly believe that you will be rich since there is no shortage of jobs, and there are thousands of opportunities available to you.

After countless hours of watching YouTube and reading books, a couple of weeks pass, and you decide to walk into the hospital. You have to deal with your first patient, and you remember everything you saw in the videos. You decide to start with the easy task of drawing some blood. It turns out you didn't know the correct procedure and had to try multiple times before hitting the vein. You start with a $1,000 fine, but you think everything will be fine since you will still get paid a bit for the bloodwork you managed to do, which will reduce the amount of the fine.

Then you receive a call from the lab saying that you used the wrong tube and they won't be able to use the sample you collected. You won‚Äôt get paid at all.

Your second patient comes in with a fever and a sore throat. You prescribe them Tylenol and tell them to rest. You get paid a few hundred dollars, and your confidence is through the roof! First completed job ‚Äì now you really think this is for you, and that money will come easily.

Your confidence is built up so much that you tell yourself you‚Äôre ready for open-heart surgery. It starts off fine since you watched thousands of videos on the subject, but the lack of practice hits you hard. You cut too deep, and the patient passes away. You‚Äôre fined $100,000. Now you‚Äôve lost all your life savings and learned the hard lesson that you need to practice more.

You repeat the process countless times, eventually concluding that this is a scam, that no one can work in the medical field, and that you were robbed of your hard-earned money.

You blame everyone but yourself for your lack of knowledge and practice. You think that if you were not capable of doing it, no one can. Little did you know, 99.99% of the other people who tried to follow the same route as you also failed. Now you believe even more that it was a scam.

Becoming a nurse, doctor, surgeon, etc., takes YEARS of study. They do internships, practice with the best, and won‚Äôt make it to the end of their studies if they are not good enough. They have put in countless hours, and they need to have a passion for healthcare and helping people. They need years and years of actual practice before becoming really good at what they do. It‚Äôs not something that is suited for everyone. It is not something that is easily attainable.

I don‚Äôt have the actual numbers, but if we were to look at the number of people who failed in the medical field after earning a degree, it would be significantly less than 99%. They had a system in place, they learned everything before day one, and they paid thousands of dollars to go to university to get the right information. They did not learn from a nobody on YouTube. They had mentors and did simulations before touching a real patient.

Are you getting where I‚Äôm going with this? You probably entered the complex field of investments without preparation. You thought that weeks, months, or even a couple of years would be sufficient for you to be good. This is not realistic at all. It‚Äôs okay to use what is available to you to learn, but don‚Äôt expect it to make you good in a matter of days.

Trading is not just about trendlines and volume. To be a good trader, you need much more. You need discipline, you need to open your mind to learn for the rest of your life, you need a system, you need risk management, you need knowledge about economics, etc.

If you come into this crazy world without any education, you will spiral endlessly and gain too much confidence when you have a lucky gain. You need to pay attention to what works, why it worked, and what doesn‚Äôt. If you‚Äôre really motivated, it is possible ‚Äì just like it‚Äôs possible to become a surgeon ‚Äì but no, it‚Äôs not for everybody.

It needs to be something you enjoy and are genuinely interested in, not just an easy way to make money.",13,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iuu16m/the_harsh_truth_about_trading_why_most_fail_and/
