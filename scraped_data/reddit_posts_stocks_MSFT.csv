1740268666.0,1ivwrt6,Oversold? Why I am Buying / DCA-ing the Dip On Monday,"A lot of Friday sell off was an amalgamation of many things, but here's why I think it's oversold and that that a bounce is coming. Many forgot that the monthly expiration was Friday for the options market. Max pain was around 601 for SPY (where most contracts expire worthless). Market makers dumped most of their hedge by selling their stocks as max pain was hit on monthly expiration and a ton of calls expired so they don't need to deliver the stocks owed (which I bet they will bid back on Monday). Also a lot of puts were bought so they needed to short the market even more in order to hedge (there's a lot of put interest right now; almost a 3:1 ratio). All of this compounded and caused a massive 100 point drop in the market.

Sure the Tariff narrative is sold to us create to ton of bearish sentiment, but as you guys saw, if he says one thing about pausing tariffs, striking a deal, or pausing their unemployment plan, then the market will bounce to higher highs, and those that sold at bottom are going to end up having to buy at the top.

Plan: Overall, I am gonna stick to my plan of not trying to time the bottom, and continue to buy each dip. A lot of stocks like CFLT, UPST, APP, and even HOOD are back to near pre-earning levels even after a successful earnings beat. So as long as NVIDIA doesn't completely s\*\*\* the bed and if Jpowell doesn't decide to hike rates during FOMC, then I am DCAing and buying the dip at open. Buy (slowly) when most others are fearful.",5,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivwrt6/oversold_why_i_am_buying_dcaing_the_dip_on_monday/
1740264111.0,1ivv6ti,MELI: The $114B Tech Giant You Probably Haven't Discussed Enough,"Been diving into stocks outside the US lately, and I stumbled upon MercadoLibre (MELI). I know it's been around for a while, but searching this sub, I was surprised to see how little it's discussed here. Figured I'd share my thoughts and hear what others think.

**Quick Overview:**  
MercadoLibre is basically Latin America's Amazon + PayPal combined. They run the largest e-commerce platform in Latin America and have a massive fintech operation (Mercado Pago) that's becoming a beast of its own.

**Key Stats:**

* Market Cap: $114B
* Revenue: $18.4B (TTM), up from $7B in 2021
* Profit Margin: 9%
* Free Cash Flow: $6.18B (TTM), up from $356M in 2021
* EPS Growth: 92% (TTM)
* ROE: 51%
* Forward P/E: 51 (PEG ratio: 1.37)
* Balance Sheet: More cash than debt
* Expected Revenue Growth: \~25% (analyst consensus)

**What Caught My Eye:**

1. Their financials are solid and getting better - that FCF growth is insane
2. They're profitable while still growing rapidly
3. The valuation looks high at first (51 P/E), but with their growth rate, the PEG ratio of 1.37 doesn't seem crazy

**The ""But What About"" Part:**  
Yeah, there are the usual emerging market concerns - political instability, currency risks, regulatory uncertainty, etc. But honestly, looking at the past few years, even US companies aren't immune to these issues anymore.

**Discussion Points:**

1. How do you view emerging market risks in today's global economy? Are we overplaying these risks for companies like MELI?
2. The Latin American e-commerce market is way less saturated than the US - how much runway for growth is left?
3. Their fintech division is killing it in a region where many people are still unbanked. Could this be their biggest growth driver?
4. With their market cap over $100B, are they still flying under the radar of US investors?

I feel like we spend so much time discussing the same US tech stocks, we might be missing some interesting opportunities elsewhere. MELI seems to have the scale, growth, and fundamentals that we usually get excited about.

What are your thoughts? Anyone been following this company closely? Would love to hear both bull and bear cases.",31,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivv6ti/meli_the_114b_tech_giant_you_probably_havent/

1740256160.0,1ivs8vg,Is DIS stock just permanently dead / broken,"Recently bought shares a little bit before their last earnings report on hopes Bob Iger could continue to turn the company into a profitable behemoth again, and looking to diversify out of high multiple tech stocks 

The numbers turned out great on that report - they had beat EPS by over 20% (beat revenue by a hair) and reaffirmed the strong guidance given in the previous quarter. Disney+ has now been profitable for 3 quarters in a row after bleeding money. Parks and cruises are doing great - this quarter even had hurricanes shuttering business and still did had beats across the board

Trading after the call surged up 5% to $118 and some change, then had a brutal reversal midday; it now finds itself at $108 and some change and is just dripping downwards every day

I’m a little confused on this one - since the report, it’s done nothing but receive upgrades, upwards price target revisions (JP Morgan, GS, Morgan Stanley, and a bunch of others all in $130-140 range now), and upwards earnings revisions. And it’s done nothing but go down. 

The only thing I have seen is that Disney+ lost subscribers - but it was forecast, and beat anyways. They had hiked prices and the forecast was to lose 1.5M subscribers and came in at losing half that. Plus, Disney+ is just one of their streaming services - they actually gained overall because Hulu came in strong. Not to mention streaming is one component in Disney’s earnings

I also saw that Cramer has been pounding the table on the stock. Maybe that’s the reason (joking)

Thoughts? Is this just a dead stock? I don’t believe that past performance dictates future returns, but it’s done nothing for 10 years besides the covid mania",52,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivs8vg/is_dis_stock_just_permanently_dead_broken/

1740246640.0,1ivojfe,"Medpace Holdings, Inc. (MEDP)","Medpace is an outsourced biotech research facility. Smaller biotechs rent their facilities to test products to see if they can go live.

Medpace is looking cheap from low sentiment due to changes with possible research cuts from DOGE and RFK increasing uncertainty.

I have previously posted about a quantitative tool ( https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1h8g3i5/decades_of_backtesting_insights_that_changed_how/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button ) I use to review stocks

That tool gives MEDP a score of 99.71 out of 100

Here is their investor presentation: https://investor.medpace.com/static-files/b1635c97-a0e6-48ba-8df4-d8583d055558

My basic pitch is the concerns are overstated and advancements with AI will increase the needs of their services as more possible drugs are brought to market. Their value proposition is significant. Your drug may fail, why spend the CAPEX on your own research facility when you could rent ours?

(VIGAX, VTI, VIG, SCHD, SCHY, BNDI, JAAA, JBBB, SGOV)

My logic is that my portfolio is not only at an all-time high (+37% since Jan 1 2024), but somehow added 8.5% since the start of the year (figs do not include fresh investment). That seems a bit wild, honestly; it speaks to me of exuberance. And in terms of financial planning, I am already where I would modestly project to be in autumn 2026. So that made me inclined to hedge a bit and lock in that tip-top portfolio value best I can.

Then add in the macro-economic issues that are starting to bubble up: inflation is sticky, consumer sentiment is icky (both of those in the USA and globally), in everyday life everybody is talking inflation again, I'm reading articles about people prepping for tough economic times, DOGE is putting metric shit-tons of people in the unemployment line, government services are going to work with less efficiency, tariffs are still coming, and Trump is a chaos agent. Who know what he cooks up next?

The last bit of my logic is something I've learned in life: I'm an average person and quite the same as anyone else. So whatever I'm thinking, no matter how much the product of my own research and attitudes, is roughly what everyone else is thinking. I'm worrying about prices, I'm re-examining spending plans, I was already stashing more cash.... so my guess is quite a few individuals (and institutions) are also thinking things are getting dicey and asking themselves, ""why not lock in at the top.""",160,221,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ivisj7/if_im_an_average_guy_then_were_all_thinking_about/
1740229487.0,1iviadm,"China risk decreased, USA risk increased?","Could we say that after electing Donald Trump and Elon Musk as presidents we could see the risk premium of USA getting slightly higher and China being relatively less riskier than before? 

Donald Trump clearly doesn't have a plan what he is going to do. He just likes to be the King of the USA. On the other hand, Elon Musk, more widely representing firstly himself and secondly the tech bros is totally different that the ""previous elite"" which has put more focus on diplomacy, ensuring stable and peaceful global order. The tech bros don't give a f about that, their interest is to maximize the development of the digital world and bringing humanity into space and their power. 

While the tech bros are clueless about the history and geopolitics in the past,. Russia and China must be happy. Instead of Russia and China being in the shadows of the USA like in the past I assume tech bros are willing to give them open hands to do whatever they want if they just cooperate with them with the tech visions.

  
This would mean that economically (for China) the risks for China doing something stupid is not as severe as before and the countries surrounding China and whole Europe on the other hand are less attractive due to their weakened security position. I still don't believe investors would trust their money on the CCP.

I am sure Europe will get their act together when they realize the tech bros are not helping them because their interest are in deregulation of Europe by supporting the right wing parties of France, UK and Germany who in exchange would serve the tech bros. This will however not happen, due to people in UK and Germany being on average highly educated compared to  average population in the red states. 

  
China and Russia will of course want to destroy the USA dominance and rules based global order if they are given the chance because it has been blocking their imperialistic visions.  Tech bros and Trump are giving them a chance.

* Q4 Adjusted EBITDA improved +$729 million YoY (-$277 million Q4 '24 compared to -$1,006 million Q4 '23)

* Q4 operating expenses decreased 15% YoY

* For the full year, Rivian posted a $4.75 billion loss, with revenue of $4.97 billion, reflecting a 12% increase.

* Expects to expand capital expenditures to $1,600 million - $1,700 million as it prepares to launch its new ""R2"" vehicle in first-half 2026.

And while not the biggest headline stat, one of the more shocking numbers of the report to me was their claim that the material costs of the R2 will be *half* of the R1:

> Our focus on cost efficiency across the business is critical for the launch of our mass market product, R2. The R2 bill of materials is approximately 95% sourced and is expected to be approximately half that of the improved R1 bill of materials.

That's a pretty wild improvement if even remotely true.

1740162449.0,1iuxvqp,Predictions on Nvidia Stock,"Hi everyone,



So my brother is shorting nvidia stock but I conversely hold nvidia stock and I am predicting/hoping it will go up in price. When I asked him this and asked for more detail this is what he responded with:



1-He states that it is price valuation has ballooned way too quickly and is a bubble. So there will be a massive correction.



2-He states that they only really do graphics cards and software and with such a narrow market focus it makes no sense why they are the world's second most valuable company.



3-He states that ai technology is overhyped and it has reached the top of its s-curve.



4-He states that would be hard to improve the hardware without a breakthrough from quantum computing which will take quite a few years.



5-He states that most modern gamers now prefer older games and indie games.

1740162077.0,1iuxqa1,"Microsoft CEO says there is an 'overbuild' of AI systems, dismisses AGI milestones as show of progress","[https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-there-is-an-overbuild-of-ai-systems-dismisses-agi-milestones-as-show-of-progress](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-there-is-an-overbuild-of-ai-systems-dismisses-agi-milestones-as-show-of-progress)

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sat at an interview where he outlined the company’s plan for artificial intelligence, surprising some in the space in an hour-long session with Dwarkesh Patel. Nadella talked about how AI's impact should be measured, the exponential growth for compute demand, its practical applications, and how it will affect humans — and Microsoft’s recent quantum breakthrough. However, one of the biggest revelations in the interview was his approach to building more hardware for AI.

Nadella says that Microsoft will still need to build compute that can “actually help me not only train the next big model but also serve the next big model.” However, he also said that “there will be an overbuild” and that “it’s not just companies deploying, countries are going to deploy capital”. The Microsoft CEO said that even though he builds a lot, he also plans to lease a lot of compute. “I am thrilled that I’m going to be leasing a lot of capacity in ’27, ’28,” Nadella said. “Because I look at the builds, and I’m saying, ‘This is fantastic.’ The only thing that’s going to happen with all the compute build is the prices are going to come down.”

He likened this mindset of putting up more compute on the supply side argument of “Hey, let me build it and they’ll come.” However, he pointed out that supply and demand must have some equilibrium, and that he’s tracking both sides of the equation. He said that you have to have proof that initial investments in AI hardware would translate into demand, ensuring that you can reinvest your capital.

# Backing off of AGI

Nadella also said that general intelligence milestones aren’t the real indicators of how AI has come along. “Us self-claiming some AGI milestone, that’s just nonsensical benchmark hacking to me.” Instead, he compared AI to the invention of the steam engine during the Industrial Revolution. “The winners are going to be the broader industry that uses this commodity (AI) that, by the way, is abundant. Suddenly productivity goes up and the economy is growing at a faster rate,” said the CEO. He then added later, “The real benchmark is the world growing at 10%.”

The Microsoft CEO did not explicitly say that his company will stop building AI data centers, especially as the company has just signed a contract to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant for its data centers. However, it seems that he’s already put a cap on their capital expenditure, especially as competitors are also putting up their own infrastructure. Instead, Microsoft might lease capacity from them.

Aside from all this, Nadella also showed off Microsoft’s breakthrough quantum chip, which he calls a “transistor moment” in quantum computing. The greatest advancement here is that the development could potentially make it feasible to build a quantum computer with millions of qubits, allowing the company to build a “utility-scale quantum computer.” Nadella even claimed that they’ll actually be able to build this in about four years’ time.

1740149409.0,1iusmvm,Assessing Lockheed Martin's Future Amid Recent Earnings and Political Climate,"I've been closely monitoring Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) and wanted to gather insights on its potential trajectory given recent developments.​

Recent Earnings Highlights:

Q4 2024 Performance: Net sales were $18.6 billion, slightly down from $18.9 billion in Q4 2023. Net earnings stood at $527 million ($2.22 per share), impacted by $1.7 billion in losses from classified programs. ​

Stock Reaction: Following the earnings release, LMT's stock experienced a 9.2% decline, influenced by the dip in net sales and a conservative profit outlook for 2025. ​

Political and Industry Context:

Defense Budget Considerations: The current administration is evaluating defense budget adjustments, with discussions about potential cuts to reallocate funds toward border security and drone programs. While initial reports suggested significant reductions, officials have indicated a more modest $50 billion reallocation. ​

Competitive Landscape: Traditional defense contractors like Lockheed Martin are facing increased competition from tech firms entering the defense sector. Companies such as Palantir and SpaceX are bringing innovative approaches, potentially reshaping the industry's dynamics. 

Financial Outlook: Given the recent earnings and potential budget reallocations, how do you foresee Lockheed Martin's financial performance evolving in the near term?​

Market Position: With tech companies making inroads into defense, what strategies should Lockheed Martin adopt to maintain its competitive edge?​

Investment Perspective: Considering the current political and economic landscape, do you view LMT as a buy, hold, or sell?",26,17,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iusmvm/assessing_lockheed_martins_future_amid_recent/

1740143372.0,1iuqidy,DOJ Investigates Medicare Billing Practices at UnitedHealth (UNH),"**Link to report:** [https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-doj-diagnosis-investigation-66b9f1db?mod=hp\_lead\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/unitedhealth-medicare-doj-diagnosis-investigation-66b9f1db?mod=hp_lead_pos1)

The Justice Department has launched an investigation into UnitedHealth Group’s UNH Medicare billing practices in recent months, people familiar with the matter say.

The new civil fraud investigation is examining the company’s practices for recording diagnoses that trigger extra payments to its Medicare Advantage plans, including at physician groups the insurance giant owns. 

A series of articles in The Wall Street Journal last year showed that Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. Attorneys with the Justice Department as recently as Jan. 31 interviewed medical providers named in the articles.

In the Medicare Advantage system, insurers get lump-sum payments from the federal government to oversee enrollees’ Medicare benefits. When patients have certain diagnoses, the payments go up, creating an incentive to diagnose more diseases. 

The Medicare billing investigation adds to the scrutiny on UnitedHealth, the $400 billion company that owns the largest U.S. health insurer and a sprawling network of other health-industry assets including its doctor practices, a large pharmacy-benefit manager and data and technology operations.

The civil investigation, some of the people said, is separate from a longer-running Justice Department antitrust probe that the Journal reported last February. The DOJ also has sued to block UnitedHealth’s $3.3 billion planned acquisition of home-health company  Amedisys on antitrust grounds

A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General, which is also involved in the civil fraud probe, declined to comment. 

UnitedHealth declined to comment. UnitedHealth previously has said its practices lead to more accurate diagnoses, that it performs well in Medicare audits and that its approach benefits patients.

In December, the Journal reported that its analysis of billions of Medicare records showed that patients examined by UnitedHealth-employed doctors had huge increases in lucrative diagnoses after joining the company’s Medicare Advantage plans.

Doctors said UnitedHealth, based in the Minneapolis area, trained them to document revenue-generating diagnoses, including some they felt were obscure or irrelevant. The company also used software to suggest conditions and paid bonuses for considering the suggestions, among other tactics, according to the doctors.

Last summer, the Journal also reported that UnitedHealth added diagnoses to patients’ records for conditions that no doctor treated, which triggered an extra $8.7 billion in federal payments in 2021. The untreated diagnoses stemmed from sources including in-home visits by nurses working for the company’s HouseCalls unit. Each visit by the UnitedHealth-employed nurses was worth an average of $2,735 in additional federal payments a Journal analysis of Medicare data spanning 2019 to 2021 found. 

Last month, Justice Department lawyers from the offices of the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota and the Washington, D.C.-based Civil Division contacted at least three doctors and a nurse practitioner who were named in the Journal’s story on UnitedHealth-owned clinics. One of the people was told the health department’s Office of Inspector General was involved as well.

Three said they were questioned about specific diagnoses UnitedHealth promoted for employees to use with patients, incentive arrangements and pressure to add the diagnoses. At least two provided documents, including a contract with a UnitedHealth unit, to the Justice Department. 

Valerie O’Meara, a nurse practitioner who worked for UnitedHealth in Washington state, said she was interviewed on Jan. 31 by Justice Department attorneys who were interested in the company software that suggested diagnoses and the role of a UnitedHealth manager who she said urged her to make new diagnoses beyond what doctors had treated. 

The attorneys zeroed in on certain diagnoses the company often suggested, such as an obscure hormonal condition called secondary hyperaldosteronism, she said. The Journal’s analysis found the condition was rarely diagnosed by Medicare doctors not working for UnitedHealth.

O’Meara said the attorneys focused on her account of how she was told she could add the hyperaldosteronism diagnosis to patients’ records without a lab test. 

More broadly, she said, “they were looking at, ‘Is this abuse?’ ” 

UnitedHealth has said its practices help detect diseases earlier, saving money for the health system. The company says Medicare Advantage plans generate better health outcomes and reduce costs.

In a press release published on its website on Dec. 30, UnitedHealth said the Journal’s articles “rely on often incomplete and inaccurate data to conduct flawed studies through a murky government ‘agreement’.” 

The Journal’s analyses used data UnitedHealth and other Medicare Advantage insurers themselves submitted to the federal government for payment purposes. Reporters accessed the data under a standard research agreement with the agency overseeing Medicare. 

UnitedHealth has faced investigations of its diagnosis-documenting practices before, and its Medicare payments have been examined in health department inspector general reports. The Justice Department took over an earlier lawsuit by a former UnitedHealth employee alleging the company failed to retract inaccurate diagnoses added to patients’ records. 

UnitedHealth has disputed the allegations against it in that continuing case.",44,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iuqidy/doj_investigates_medicare_billing_practices_at/

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

1740105078.0,1iug8d0,Dont sleep on WISE,"Wise PLC (LON:WISE) could be a compelling stock pick due to its strong fundamentals and market position as of February 20, 2025. The fintech, known for low-cost international money transfers, boasts a 30% revenue CAGR over five years, a robust 36% operating margin, and a growing user base of over 10 million, making it profitable and scalable. Trading at a forward P/E of \~30, it’s reasonably valued for its 20-30% annual growth, especially compared to peers like Adyen or PayPal, while its disruptive model targets the bloated fees of traditional banks. With expanding offerings like multi-currency accounts and debit cards, plus tailwinds from globalization, Wise is gaining momentum (up 53% in six months) and analyst support, though competition, regulation, and volatility remain risks worth noting. If you’re betting on fintech eating into legacy finance, Wise blends growth and stability nicely.",30,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iug8d0/dont_sleep_on_wise/

With using a conservative discount rate and execution risk premium I arrive at around $59 a share or $47 if you like a 20% safety factor. Today they showed 60% yoy FCF growth. So basically the main assumption is if they grow they hit that next year and then start to taper that growth rate down over 10 years to terminal growth of 6% this is the intrinsic value of the stock. 

I'm looking for feedback on this model. Let me know what you think of the assumptions and growth rate projections. Let me know if you think I'm crazy or it sucks or whatever! Thanks in advance!

1740096066.0,1iudefo,Amazon surpasses Walmart in revenue for the first time,"Amazon has dethroned Walmart in quarterly revenue for the first time ever.

Amazon said earlier this month that it brought in $187.8 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter. That beat Walmart’s sales for the period, which came in at $180.5 billion, the company reported on Thursday.

Since 2012, Walmart has held the distinction of being the top revenue generator each quarter, a title it gained after overtaking oil giant Exxon Mobil.

Walmart still leads the way in annual sales, though Amazon is gaining ground. Walmart is projected to reel in $708.7 billion in the fiscal year ahead while Amazon’s full-year revenue for 2025 is expected to reach $700.8 billion, according to FactSet.

Amazon’s core retail unit remains its biggest revenue generator, but its top line is also being fueled by its massive cloud computing, advertising and seller services businesses. Third-party seller services, which includes commissions and fees collected by Amazon on fulfillment and shipping, advertising and customer support, accounted for 24.5% of the company’s total sales last year. Amazon Web Services was responsible for nearly 17%.

Walmart has looked to its chief rival for ways to sustain sales growth. The company operates a third-party marketplace and offers sellers fulfillment services, although both businesses are a fraction of the size of Amazon’s. Walmart has also launched an advertising business and a loyalty program for shoppers, called Walmart+, that competes with Amazon Prime.

1740092132.0,1iubyeu,Could this be an insane little risk investing strategy over the long run? I’m new to these direction daily ETF’s,"
Basically there are these new ETF's called direction daily that try to multiply a stocks earnings and losses. For example, there is the direxion daily S&P500 bull 3x(SPXL) that pretty much 3x's the s&p 500 gains/losses. This last year the S&P went up 22%, this 3x direction daily stock went up 59%, which comes out to 2.68 times the S&P 500's gains.

If people view the S&P as a safe bet in the long term that consistently produces 9-10% returns on investment, could I just put my money into these 3x etf's and make anywhere from 20-30% year over year? Where's the risk involved in the long run? I just don't know too much about how these ETF's work and if there are other cons to investing in them. Perhaps somebody here would know more? Or would know another reddit be page that would know more?

Because if this stuff is legit this thing could be the best wealth creation tool ever to exist. Every investor dreams of having year over year returns like Warren buffets 23% anual compounding rate. If I put 100,000 dollars into this thing and I got a 26.8% return and kept this thing in there for 30 years, I would have 124 million dollars!",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iubyeu/could_this_be_an_insane_little_risk_investing/

With Tesla sales dropping all over the world, BYD is one of the carmakers that are poised to fill that void.

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

I have an individual TOD account through Fidelity which I opened about 1.5 years ago. This was a phase in my life where I had time/money to research and invest in interesting company stocks that I thought would be good investments. I started out with about $900 and it's grown to about $1650, with positions in 20 companies across several sectors. 

  
I no longer have the time to dedicate to keeping up with trading and shifting my positions around based on data and research. I'd like to just ""cash out"" this account by selling all my shares and moving the money to a Roth IRA or taxable account where I can just buy some index funds and sit on them.



If I sell and make realized gains of \~$700 (mix of short- and long-term gains and I am in the 22% bracket, so let's say 20% cap gains tax rate overall), will I pay around $140 in taxes? Is this inevitable or since I have a relatively small portfolio are there any exceptions or contingencies I could take to keep more of the money? Or, better yet, is there an easier way to convert my holdings on Fidelity straight to buying an index fund in my Roth IRA (say, FZROX)?

1. Valuations are sky-high.
2. We're seeing mass layoffs. 
3. The government's role in the economy is further decreasing via spending cuts. 
4. Inflation is still above target; hence, monetary conditions are tight. 
5. Tariffs will further aggravate inflation.

To summarize, money supply is on a downward trend and yet costs will continue to rise. Does this not set up the US (and hence, the world) economy for a recession/stagflation scenario? And how much of a haircut will stocks trading way above historical averages get?

1740042845.0,1ituftv,'Stagflation' fears haunt US markets despite Trump's pro-growth agenda,"https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/stagflation-fears-haunt-us-markets-despite-trumps-pro-growth-agenda-2025-02-20/

Feb 20 (Reuters) - Stubborn inflation and President Donald Trump's hard-line trade policies have rekindled fears of stagflation, a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s, even as markets remain upbeat on his pro-growth agenda.

The potential return of stagflation, which would pressure a range of assets, has been flagged periodically over the past 50 years but not materialized as a real threat to investor portfolios. While economists and portfolio managers are not ready to say that this time is different, the dreaded scenario has crept back as a key risk for investors in recent weeks, as the prospect of trade wars and punitive tariffs cast a shadow over U.S. growth.

""Stagflation has definitely re-emerged as a possibility because we have these policies that could hurt consumer demand even while persistent inflation limits the Federal Reserve's ability to maneuver,"" said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager for Brandywine Global's fixed income strategies. ""It's not a zero-possibility scenario any more, by a long shot.""

A key piece of the stagflation puzzle - inflation that refuses to cool down - lodged more firmly into place earlier this month, when government data showed consumer prices rose in January at their fastest monthly pace since August 2023, bringing the annual rate of inflation to 3%.

The other piece of the puzzle, U.S. economic growth, hangs in the balance, with Trump's tariffs threatening to add inflationary pressure that could tip the scale.

""What continues to concern us more than the risk of inflation is stagflation,"" said Tim Urbanowicz, chief investment strategist at Innovator Capital Management. ""There is that sticky base of inflation to contend with but on top of that, tariffs have the potential to slow down the economy by becoming a tax on consumers and weighing on profits and economic growth.""

A Bank of America survey of global fund managers on Tuesday showed the proportion of investors expecting stagflation - defined by the bank as below-trend growth and above-trend inflation - over the next year stood at a seven-month high. At the same time, investors remained bullish on stocks, with a trade war seen as a low-probability risk, the survey showed.

While Trump postponed imposing new tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico for a month at the beginning of February, he has rolled out a new 10% levy on all Chinese imports and announced tariffs on global steel and aluminum imports.

He has also tasked his economics team with devising plans for reciprocal tariffs on every country that taxes U.S. imports, and this week said he plans to introduce 25% tariffs on autos, semiconductors and pharmaceutical imports.

Some investors believe any hit to growth from tariffs would be temporary.
Over a longer-term horizon, tariffs could even promote growth, said Maddi Dessner, head of asset class services at Capital Group, boosting industries that will benefit from less competition globally. On the other hand, their initial impact could increase price pressures.

""The truth is it's probably going to be somewhere in between those two things,"" she said, adding tariffs were partly why Capital Group now forecasts 10-year Treasury yields at 3.9% over a 20-year horizon, up from a 3.7% forecast last year.

'NOT THERE YET'

Stagflation emerged as a source of anxiety as recently as 2022, when inflation rates spiked and stock and bond prices plummeted, but that scenario did not materialize as inflation eventually eased and growth remained resilient.
Many believe that the U.S. economy will once again steer clear of stagflation.
So-called core inflation at about 3% remains well below the levels hit in the 1970s, when the annual rate of core inflation averaged about 7%. This time around inflation expectations remain ""anchored"", meaning the long-term inflation picture is not fluctuating wildly with each fresh piece of economic data, said Evercore ISI in a recent note.

Still, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned the market may be underestimating stagflation risks. The prospect of large-scale deportations of workers without visas or other work documents, another Trump campaign pledge, also would fuel inflation, he noted.
""Tariffs and deportations are a recipe for inflation and hurt growth; both are negative supply shocks,"" he said, adding that negative supply shocks such as a crude oil price surge contributed to 1970s stagflation.

Guneet Dhingra, head of US rates strategy at BNP Paribas, said the market has been ""complacent"" over the past six months, focusing on Trump's pro-growth policies. He said stagflation-wary investors could sell two-year Treasuries, likely to lose value due to higher inflation, and buy 10-year Treasuries that would benefit in a low-growth scenario.

Surging interest in gold , which hit another all-time high on Wednesday, suggests some investors are worried, as gold is one of a handful of assets that hold their value in a stagflationary environment, said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors.

The other big winner would be cash, said Brandywine's McIntyre, but he added that for now he was holding back from making big shifts to cash-like fixed income instruments.

""I'm not there yet,"" McIntyre said.

1740025796.0,1itq3ok,DD - Compass Inc - There's Potential Here,"I'm going all in on Compass (COMP) tomorrow after *hopefully* a small pullback, because I believe this stock is going to 12 or 13 within the short term: a month or two.

**Average Vol:** 6.55m  
**52w High/Low:** 10.25/2.89

**EPS:** \-0.31

Obviously these numbers seem pretty bad on their own without context. My guess is that the market is valuing more like a tech-growth stock, and if we've learned anything from Carvana... sometimes the story and momentum are most important things.

Now, I know the real estate market is objectively terrible and probably isn't getting better in the near term, but this might be the exception in the short-term because it has been vastly outperforming the sector and the market. There is a lot to like here. Note: My focus in this is mainly as a swing trade, I don't typically hold long term.

**Take a look at the highlights from today's earnings report (via yahoo)** 

**Revenue:** $1.38 billion in Q4, a 25.9% increase year-over-year.

* **Adjusted EBITDA:** $16.7 million in Q4, including $4.2 million in M&A transaction costs.
* **Net Loss:** $40.5 million in Q4, improved from a $83.7 million loss a year ago.

* **Principal Agent Count:** Grew by 21% year-over-year, with 3,069 net new agents in 2024.
* **Title and Escrow Attach Rate:** Improved by over 800 basis points year-over-year.
* **Market Share:** Increased from 4.41% to 5.06% in Q4, a 65 basis point gain year-over-year.
* **Q1 2025 Revenue Guidance:** $1.35 billion to $1.475 billion.
* **Q1 2025 Adjusted EBITDA Guidance:** $11 million to $25 million.

* **Cash and Cash Equivalents:** $234 million at the end of Q4.

Their financials are trending in the right direction, especially given the pressure the real estate market has been under lately.

So the regard in me came to the conclusion that they are essentially a combination of an Uber and Zillow: that specializing in selling house to the super rich.

*What I mean by that:*

* **The way they are using their technology is potentially disruptive like Uber.** They aren't just a marketplace like Zillow which makes money selling leads; they're a whole ass cloud-based real estate brokerage.
* **Their work force pays them** to use their platform which has a proprietary CRM system, automated marketing tools, analytics, and uses AI to help them determine the price, etc. Agents make commissions.
* **They also do a shit ton of acquisitions (24 so far).** This is strategic positioning to gain market share when mortgage rates finally come down.
* **Keep in mind** that a significant portion of their business and marketing image is tailored to ***the ultra rich***\*.\* From what I could find, 35% of their 22,000 active listing are listed under Private Exclusive. They also recruit luxury real estate agents for this specific purpose.

**I also just got to looking at the dark pool data from today and my interpretation was this:**

**Dark Pool Data:**  
**Net Vol. :** \-3,504,876  
**Net Vol$ :** \-35,889,930  
**Position :** \-13,369,776  
**Position$:** \-110,410,00

Given the massive volume from today's trading sessions ([6X@29.37m](mailto:6X@29.37m)), huge net-short volume that aligns with the price action, and sharp decrease in the rolling 20-day short volume: this appears to be a genuine breakout instead of a temporary pump.

**25%** of the short float was liquidated or covered today with almost no pullbacks at 6 times the normal volume. This means buyers were driving the price action,

The way it melted up, adding $1.5B to its cap makes me think that the market is positioning for a move to $12-$13 dollars per share, with $10 is the new base.

Overall dark pool position is still negative, so that's always a short exposure risk, but I'm biting and going all in tomorrow.

**Bonus:**

***Options are stupid cheap for it.***

1740022959.0,1itp8rb,"Cash, Gold or Stocks with the looming recession?","
I just inherited 100k from my grandfather and I have no idea how to invest it responsibly right now.  The market seems unstable, but inflation seems close and WTF is going on right now in Washington? 
I know this is a novice question… but I am a novice. 

For Context; I am 30, I own a small country house and another small property, hold about 20k in gold and silver but I have zero stocks, bonds or any traditional investment portfolio of any type. My finances are decent, I make about 70k a year and I don’t live big. I have a 4 month emergency fund, own my vehicles and don’t have any other debt aside from my mortgage. I just graduated college with my Bachelors (two actually) and I have some decent job prospects on the horizon. 

Ironically before inheriting this money I opened a Roth IRA to begin investing in more traditional methods rather than just buying precious metals. 

I considered just buying a some general ETFs, maybe 20k in the Dow, 30k in the S&P 500 and 20k in the NASDAQ?  Also considered buying some Swiss CHF because seems to be a very consistent currency and as well as a small amount of Chinese Yuen for speculation. 

These are just spitball ideas, I’m not familiar with these products. 

Any advice would be really helpful.



Also, I’m 100% happy to just buy a kilo of gold and call it a day.

Thanks!

1740017137.0,1itncot,"Palantir plunges after CEO Karp changes share sales plan, Pentagon budget cut report","The share price of Palantir fell as much as 12.5% Wednesday after news that CEO Alex Karp had adopted a new stock trading plan, and a report that the Pentagon has been ordered to prepare to cut the U.S. defense budget by 8% each year for the next five years.

Palantir is best known for its contracting work providing software and technology services for defense agencies.

On Tuesday night, Palantir in a regulatory filing disclosed that Karp’s new plan will allow him to sell nearly 10 million shares of company stock in the next six months.

The Washington Post on Wednesday said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior Pentagon leaders and other military brass to develop plans to slash the defense budget over the next half decade. The budget for the current fiscal year is around $850 billion.

The Post reported that Hegseth ordered the proposed cuts to be drawn up by Monday.

Palantir closed trading Wednesday at $112.06 per share, a drop of 10%. Shares were down more than 1.5% in after-hours trading.

The company, whose market capitalization tops $255 billion, in early February reported $828 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, with adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share.

Before Wednesday’s abrupt drop, Palantir had been one of the top-performing stocks in the U.S. for the last two years, including a share price rise of nearly 50% in the year to date.

Palantir trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 600-to-1.

The Trump administration has been engaged in a wide-ranging effort to slash government spending and the number of federal government workers since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second nonconsecutive term on Jan. 20.

Trump appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk to oversee that effort, dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency.”

Musk and Trump have come under fire for their methods in achieving DOGE’s goal, with some steps being challenged successfully in federal court.

On Tuesday, Karp, who co-founded the company with Peter Thiel, defended Musk during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

“What the progressive left should be doing is saying, ‘OK, Elon, you’re clearly the most qualified person in the world to do something like this. We want a dialog with you about what you’re doing, how you’re doing,’” Karp said.

“I don’t believe that’s happened,” he added.

1740012691.0,1itlt6o,Nvidia Earnings Sentiment,"With the current information I have, I think nvidia's growth is slowing down, and that they're gonna stay conservative to beat earnings. This, paired with their trend of falling on earnings regardless of surprises like during their previous two earnings, is gonna happen again and make the stock dip a few %.

Things to keep in mind :

1. Nvidia is gonna have to address the deepseek impacts, what could they possibly say to deter the fears that AI is getting more efficient to compute? It's not a question of chip performance, it's a question of being able to do the same or more, on less. Deepseek, while clearly did not cost 5.6mln to develop, still came out to have a pricetag that was significantly cheaper than OpenAI's development cost of 20bln (between 1-2bln, and this was on older Nvidia hardware). It's going to get increasingly more difficult to justify their exorbitant prices for their GPUs and chips, margins are gonna shrink.

2. Mag7 Capex investments mean multiple companies are going to be coming up with their own chips, while Nvidia still hold the performance lead on theirs, others like AMD could catch up in the future. Furthermore, Microsofts newest quantum chip just knocked the expectations of commercially deploying quantum computing from a couple of decades to a couple of years. While they don't have the production ready yet, they have all the infrastructure online and ready. Nvidia's monopoly is coming to an end faster than we're expecting.

3. Nvidia historically tends to fall on earnings, their previous 2 reports all led to a noticeable drop in share price, even though they were beating their main metrics by a long shot. 

What do you guys think is gonna happen post-earnings to Nvidia? I'm setting a pre-earnings target of about 145$. Eager to hear what you guys think. ",0,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itlt6o/nvidia_earnings_sentiment/

Since its heights in 2020, and admittedly some years before, I have always been bearish on Nike thinking they were an old guard fashion company that would slowly deteriote as new kings(Lulu, Aldo) rise. 

But with their new CEO being Elliott Hill, someone who started at the company over 25 years ago as an intern and quite literally worked his way to the top(look at his LinkedIn, he climbed from position to position in Nike), idk why but to me its promising. This is someone who worked in so many different positions and departments in Nike, who kept getting promotions, to me that shows he knows his shit, is good at it, works hard at it.

On top of that, with the Kim K collaboration, I think this could be a sign of Nike really trying to take back the high quality gymwear market while still having shoes, while still having sports, while still having a cheaper market with their outlet stores.

1740001068.0,1ithdwd,The new Microsoft work is moot; perspective from a physicsist,"Skip the hype from the popular science articles. Let's take a look at the ""rigorously"" reviewed Nature paper. I have rigorously in quotation marks because the process is far from it. As we will see, Nature forced the paper through while 2/4 referees did not support publication.

The paper is at [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08445-2) . You can scroll to the bottom to access the referee reports. First of all. You will see that one of the referees voluntarily revealed his name, Hao Zhang. This is the same guy that was found to have manipulated data in a [previous Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03373-x), and this paper was retracted after independent analysis found that they shifted the data manually to make the values consistent with a quantized value. So right off the bat, the Nature editor is already not doing a proper job of soliciting referees.

Now let's read the [actual referee report](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41586-024-08445-2/MediaObjects/41586_2024_8445_MOESM2_ESM.pdf). There are 4 referees, which is more than usual, presumably because it is a high profile work. At the very top, the editorial team has the following comments: 

# The editorial team wishes to point out that the results in this manuscript do not represent evidence for the presence of Majorana zero modes in the reported devices. The work is published for introducing a device  architecture that might enable fusion experiments using future Majorana zero modes.

essentially, Majorana modes are the critical piece of physics required for topological quantum computing, and microsoft DID NOT demonstrate that.

In the first round, 3 of the 4 referees declined to provide strong recommendation for publication:

Ref 1: *In summary, I have no great criticisms of the experiment and the data (which by themselves constitute a good piece of the state of the art of single-shot parity measurements in a hybrid device and their dependence on flux), but rather in the rather misleading way in which these data are presented and the extreme simplifications of the modeling which, essentially asumes a topological state and includes Majoranas by hand, yet again forcing an a priori interpretation of the data.*

Ref 2: *As stated above, the relationship to Majorana physics is not completely certain and needs some serious scrutiny.*

Ref 4: *The authors claim their work is a significant step toward the realization of topological qubits. To my view, however, the reported achievements do not meet Nature’s novelty and relevance standards. Moreover, the conclusions drawn in this work rest on questionable hypothesis and methodologies. As a result, I cannot recommend publication in Nature.*

Now, if you are familiar with publishing in the top journals Nature and Science (and I have published in and been rejected from them), you would know that three do-not-recommends and 1 neutral is automatic rejection. Most of the time, even 2/3 do-not-recommends is a full rejection.

Now the editor gave the authors a chance to respond, which is again already unusual but it's a big team so let's give them the benefit of the doubt.

The authors' reply in round 2 DID NOT convince all the referees and address their concerns. Still 2 firm do-not-recommends:

Ref 1: *Given my overall impression and comments above, I cannot recommend the paper for publication in Nature.*

Ref 4: *Due to the above reasons, I am firmly convinced this work should not be published in Nature or any other high visibility journal.*

  
The fact that this paper was still accepted is a disgrace to the scientific community.

Microsoft on Wednesday announced Majorana 1, its first quantum computing chip. 

The achievement comes after the company has spent nearly two decades of research in the field. 

Technologists believe quantum computers could one day efficiently solve problems that would be taxing if not impossible for classical computers. Today’s computers use bits that can be either on or off while quantum computers employ quantum bits, or qubits, that can operate in both states simultaneously.

Google and IBM have also developed quantum processors, as have smaller companies IonQ and Rigetti Computing. Microsoft’s quantum chip employs eight topological qubits using indium arsenide, which is a semiconductor, and aluminum, which is a superconductor. A new paper in the journal Nature describes the chip in detail.

Microsoft won’t be allowing clients to use its Majorana 1 chip through the company’s Azure public cloud, as it plans to do with its custom artificial intelligence chip, Maia 100. Instead, Majorana 1 is a step toward a goal of a million qubits on a chip, following extensive physics research.

Rather than rely on Taiwan Semiconductor or another company for fabrication, Microsoft is manufacturing the components of Majorana 1 itself in the U.S. That’s possible because the work is unfolding at a small scale.

“We want to get to a few hundred qubits before we start talking about commercial reliability,” Jason Zander, a Microsoft executive vice president, told CNBC.

In the meantime, the company will engage with national laboratories and universities on research using Majorana 1. 

Despite the focus on research, investors are fascinated by quantum.

IonQ shares went up 237% in 2024, and Rigetti gained nearly 1,500%. The two generated a combined $14.8 million in third-quarter revenue. Further gains came in January, after Microsoft issued a blog post declaring that 2025 is “the year to become quantum-ready.”

Microsoft’s Azure Quantum cloud service, which lets developers experiment with programs and algorithms, offers access to chips from IonQ and Rigetti. It’s possible that a Microsoft quantum chip might become available through Azure before 2030, Zander said.

“There’s a lot of speculation that we’re decades off from this,” he said. “We believe it’s more like years.”

Rather than exist as a stand-alone category, quantum computing might end up boosting other parts of Microsoft. For example, there’s Microsoft’s AI business, which has an annualized revenue run rate that exceeds $13 billion. Quantum computers could be used to build data used to train AI models, Zander said. 

“Now you can ask it to invent some new molecule, invent some new drug, something that really would have been impossible to do before,” Zander said.",585,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1itekzw/microsoft_reveals_its_first_quantum_computing/

I see so many posts about how the stock market is going to crash because of Trump, or because some other global event. 

And honestly, in my opinion, posts like this are sort of dramatic. Let’s realize that the last 100 years the stock market has pretty much continued to go up (with some crashes mixed in) despite everything that’s going on. Including world wars, the Great Depression, major hurricanes, major earthquakes and fires, wars with Korea, wars with Vietnam/Afganistan, constant Middle East fighting, several political scandals like watergate, the 2008 recession that scared everyone, a global pandemic, the Cold War, and so many different things. 

At the end of the day, US companies have and will continue to make more and more insane amounts of money. Stocks will continue to rise even after some downfalls. Trump will only be president for 4 years if not less if something were to happen to him in old age.
