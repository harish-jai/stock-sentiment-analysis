1740257803.0,1ivsv5d,Is this a scam? Question about a Trading Platform's Withdrawal Process,"Hey everyone,

I recently took my first step into trading by investing $200 in a platform that claims to trade on my behalf. They mentioned that they take a 10% cut of my profits, which seems fair. However, I’m encountering a strange issue.

Now that I’ve made some profits, they’re telling me that I need to pay an additional 10% on top of my earnings in order to verify the withdrawal. This raises a red flag for me. Why can’t they just deduct the 10% directly from my account before allowing me to withdraw?

Has anyone else experienced something similar? Is this a common practice in trading platforms, or should I be concerned? Looking forward to your insights!",0,18,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ivsv5d/is_this_a_scam_question_about_a_trading_platforms/
1740254110.0,1ivrgwb,"Something Tells You This Panic is Fake, at Least Temporarily","I know this will sound like hopium, but as I was just setting my limit sells in case of a tank Monday morning, it dawned on me that I was playing right into 'their' hands. This is what they want right now- retailers and low experience investors to panic for their liquidation and preferred reentry, better profit positions.

Here are the statistical reasons I've came up with as to why I think this is the case (and the market will actually go up and rebound Monday into Tuesday).

1. Game Theory: while everyone somewhat operates on this (to the benefit of the MMs making retailers panic sell to preserve capital), nobody is more greedy than the HF's. 

It is in their 'best interest' to capitalize on every opportunity that behooves them. They already have an opportunity on Monday after 2 consecutive rug pull days on most stocks, appealing stocks to boot. 

Also, if they dump all their shares too quickly, there will be no buyers left. This drop must be surgical for them to maximize the opportunity. That's why they pile on shorts and dumps in time increments, while also hedging to make it look like the knife drop has ended before the next incremental rug pull. All this causes more holders to panic sell as they avg down on each incremental drop, but eventually cave in. 

Most importantly, and perhaps most pertinent to game theory, is they are losing too as the prices tank, as are their colleagues and billionaire cohorts. This is why this tank must be surgical, which will result in keeping appealing upward movements at times (exit points for retailers to minimize losses, BE, or profit). They also have calls they don't want to all be burned through.

2. Greed- It benefits everyone collectively more if stocks are going up as spirits and morale keep money inflow coming in. If there's no more money to liquidate, HFs can't profit (like they want to). Their own companies (banks, corporations) will take a big blow in a recession, and though while banks can be bailed out, it's doubtful they'd be looking forward to the stress and the process. The numbers they enjoy hitting in profit simply won't be there if they crash the market for 2 or 3 more consecutive days- they must keep some morale and positive sentiment up while closing out their own calls by Friday.

3. Probability: the market goes up more than it goes down, and although due for a correction, many promising stocks have fell 3 out of the last 4 days, some at or more than 10% per day. While it is possible this trend continues, it's more probable, especially considering 1 and 2 points above, that Monday and Tuesday at least bounces back a little (before the next rug pull later in the week or later). 

4. X-factor: Trump and his administration have the power to turn the market around with just 1 single announcement by Sunday night into Monday morning (similar to January 13th). All Trump has to do (if he cares about his voters and citizens of the U.S.' best interest), seeing this obvious crisis in the markets, is once again delay tariffs for 30-60 days, or put out some good news economically to at least stabilize the markets, which will set up an immediate rebound. They need to be prudent and wise as to the impact they are having on the markets, and know it's in everyone's best interests to at least stop the bleeding by putting out something responsible and positive.

Though a couple of these aren't directly statistical, they directly impact the statistical performance of the markets. 

TLDR; imo anyone who panic sells and dumps on Monday morning will probably be watching potentially thousands of dollars in profits they could have gained be lost on a rebound Monday. Not to say some stop limits shouldn't be placed within reason to be safe, but the statistical odds are actually more in favor of a rebound day. Be safe and cautious, but consider what benefits the HFs and MMs the most after 2-3 consecutive rug pull red days at last week's end.

Is this a strategic move to expand its market share, or a desperate attempt to keep growth alive? We’ll talk about why investors are so divided on Celsius, the risks of competing with Monster $MNST and Red Bull, and whether its deal with Pepsi $PEP is a blessing or a ticking time bomb.

1740238477.0,1ivlbke,Why I'm Bullish on Nabtesco: The Automation Play I Can't Ignore,"
I’ve been thinking a lot about investing in **Nabtesco Corporation (6268:JP)** lately, and I wanted to lay out my reasoning for why I’m considering taking a position in this stock. It’s been a bit of a head-scratcher for me, but let me try to break it down.

# Why Nabtesco?

At its core, **Nabtesco is a leader in high-precision robotics components**, specifically their RV reducers. If you’re not familiar, RV reducers are critical components in industrial robots—they’re what help robots move with precision and efficiency. And guess what? **Nabtesco controls about 60% of the global market share for RV reducers.** That’s a huge competitive advantage, and it’s one of the primary reasons I’m intrigued by this stock.

# The Long-Term Growth Thesis

The world is moving irrevocably toward automation, and this is a trend I see only accelerating in the coming years. Here’s why:

1. **Labor Shortages and Automation**: With an aging population and a shrinking workforce (especially in Japan and other developed countries), factories are increasingly turning to automation to maintain productivity. This is where industrial robots—and Nabtesco’s RV reducers—come into play.
2. **AI and Robotics Integration**: As AI continues to advance, the integration of robots into factories becomes more seamless and cost-effective. This should drive a surge in demand for industrial robots, which in turn will require more RV reducers.
3. **Supply Chain Optimization**: Nabtesco has been expanding its production capacity, particularly with the completion of their plant in Hamamatsu. This new facility is expected to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, which should help the company scale its operations as demand grows.

If these trends materialize, I believe Nabtesco could see significant order growth. In fact, the company has already shown signs of recovery in its orders, which dropped off during the pandemic-induced slowdown. I’m hopeful that as the world continues its shift towardFactory Automation 2.0, Nabtesco will benefit handsomely.

# Why I’m Skeptical

But before I get too excited, I have to acknowledge the risks and challenges here:

1. **Profitability Concerns**: Despite the strong market position, Nabtesco’s financials aren’t exactly stellar right now. **ROIC, ROE, and ROA are all underwater, each hovering around 1% or below**. That’s worrying—and it raises questions about whether the company can actually turn its current advantages into sustainable profits.
2. **High Costs**: The company hasn’t yet seen a meaningful decline in its business costs, and this could limit its ability to increase margins even as orders pick up. For Nabtesco to really shine, they need to demonstrate that their new plant and operational improvements can drive significant cost reductions.
3. **Chinese Competitors**: While Nabtesco leads the market today, I can’t ignore the fact that Chinese companies are rapidly catching up. They could eat into market share in the not-so-distant future.
4. **Weak Competitive Moat**: I’ve always believed that **true moats are about long-term defensibility**, and technical expertise alone isn’t enough. While RV reducers are complex, the barriers to entry may not be as high as they seem, especially with increasing innovation in the space.

If Nabtesco can’t improve its profitability and sustain its margins despite growing demand, this could become a very risky investment. I’m closely monitoring whether the company can turn things around in the next 12-24 months.",0,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1ivlbke/why_im_bullish_on_nabtesco_the_automation_play_i/
1740235095.0,1ivk47p,Chinese Stocks Are Heating Up While U.S. Markets Cool Off—Alibaba’s Killing It,"Hey r/investing, anyone else noticing the wild divergence between Chinese and U.S. stocks lately? While the S&P 500 just took a 1.7% hit yesterday (closed at $6,013.13, ouch), Chinese stocks are on a tear, and I’m kinda here for it. The Hang Seng Tech Index is up 18% YTD, and names like Alibaba ($BABA) are straight-up flexing. What’s going on?

So, U.S. markets are getting jittery—weak economic data, inflation expectations spiking to levels not seen since ‘95 (per Bloomberg), and traders hitting the risk-off button hard. Meanwhile, China’s got this AI-fueled rocket fuel. DeepSeek’s chatbot hype kicked things off, and now Alibaba’s riding the wave with its Qwen 2.5 AI model and a rumored Apple hookup for iPhone AI features in China. Their latest earnings dropped Thursday, and holy crap—revenue up 7.6% to 280.15 billion yuan ($34.45B), beating estimates, and the stock popped nearly 13% in the U.S. and 10% in Hong Kong. It’s at a three-year high now, up 60%+ YTD and 80% over the past 12 months.

Why the surge? China’s pushing hard into AI and cloud (Alibaba’s cloud unit grew 13% last quarter), plus there’s buzz about more government stimulus in March. Jack Ma showing up at a Xi Jinping symposium this week didn’t hurt either—feels like Beijing’s giving tech a green light again. Compare that to the U.S., where valuations are sky-high (MSCI India’s at 21x forward P/E, while MSCI China’s chilling at 11x) and sentiment’s souring fast.

Alibaba’s the poster child here. E-commerce still dominates their revenue ($13.8B last quarter), but the AI/cloud push is what’s got investors drooling. They’re even talking about investing more in DeepSeek. Contrast that with U.S. tech giants sweating over earnings misses and macro headwinds—China’s looking like the value play right now.
What do you all think? Is this Chinese stock rally (especially $BABA) legit, or just a hype bubble waiting to pop? Are U.S. stocks oversold, or is this the start of a bigger slide? I’m tempted to rotate some cash into $BABA myself—thoughts?

1740192467.0,1iv8pmy,Apple's New Entry Looks Like It's Once Again In A Uninteresting Section - Technical Analysis Of Charts,"https://preview.redd.it/vmybh7uvslke1.png?width=2454&format=png&auto=webp&s=55da51f7dc60f1dfd58db7fea808b11deb8542c3

Analyzing the current Apple stock chart (as of February 2025, the one-day candle) shows that the price is moving above the long-term upward trend line (blue line) but has recently become volatile in the red box segment.



RSI (Relative Strength Index): The RSI at the bottom of the chart is currently at 61.17, which sits at a neutral level between overbought (over 70) and over-sold (under 30). However, there are signs of recovery after recent declines, suggesting a possibility of further upside in the near term.



Trading volume: It shows a pattern of trading volume falling sharply in the price segment, while trading volume increases during the recovery. This indicates that the buying force is strengthening. The bullish segment within the red box reflects strong buying pressure.



MACD: The MACD line crosses over the signal line and shows positive momentum; however, we should be aware of the possibility of short-term overheating as the histogram shrinks.



Support and Resistance: The support line looks like an uptrend line (about 210-215$) and the resistance looks like a recent high (about 245$). The red box section acts as a short-term resistance, and a break above this increases the likelihood of an uptrend as high as 250.



PREDICTIONS OF PREDICTIONS: They fluctuate in the range of 210-245$ in the near term, and are likely to test 245$ resistance when rebounding from the support line (210$). However, the possibility of an adjustment cannot be ruled out due to the overheating of MACD. In the medium to long term, the upward trend is likely to remain.

PLTR rallied close to a Fibonacci return of 0.5(94.34$) due to macroeconomic selling pressure, such as major shareholder selling, under RSI overbought and technical analysis. However, it failed to fill in the MACD gap and RSI has yet to enter the oversold section indicators suggest a downward trend, but the price seems to have risen and is judged to be a downward divergence, and the adjustment seems to be a little bit more. The target price is around $95.2$ What do you think?

It's hard to think the fundamentals have been damaged, and the four-hour candle shows no signs of slowing down as the MACD gap narrows yet

Based on the hour candle data, I think the adjustment is almost complete. Although I think the current location still has adjustments or fluctuations, I think it's a place to consider new entry or additional purchases

I have successfully finalized my portfolio with the sectors I was targeting and the right balance. However, I encountered issues when investing in small companies that did not live up to their promises. The main problem was that their stock prices were manipulated by market makers, short sellers, and others...

Now, I really want to find a hidden gem for the long term. I’ve noticed that two companies have experienced significant success: Innodata and TSS Inc. However, I have never seen their names mentioned anywhere as stock market gems. I wanted to know whether these two companies are truly solid for the long term or if their rise is just euphoria or unreasonable speculation.

I have also heard about Microvast and Microvision. They are much smaller, but many people talk about their huge potential (major contracts coming?). I am not a specialist, and I don’t want to fall into a bull trap or be caught in short sellers’ speculative games, waiting for a massive drop.

Therefore, I would really appreciate your opinion. Thank you.",3,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1iu0brd/innodata_and_tss_no_one_talk_about_both/
1740057454.0,1ity9ih,I Learned the Hard Way: My Mistake with CFDs and RDDT,"Like many others, I paid a high price for my ignorance.

Some time ago, I saw that Reddit was going to open up to the market, and at that time, I had enough money to buy only 2 RDDT shares (they were at 60 USD each). On the recommendation of a friend, I opened an account at [Capital.com](http://Capital.com) and bought them there.

They have a clear disclaimer stating that CFDs are complex instruments and that most people lose money. However, due to my ignorance and stupidity, I thought that CFDs were the same as stocks. My reasoning was, ""There is risk in everything... let's see what happens.""

Months passed, my profits increased, and I was very happy. Everything was going well—until recently. One night, while I was sleeping (with my phone on mute), the DeepSeek situation happened, and I lost everything I had.

As of today, there is less than 90 USD left in my [Capital.com](http://Capital.com) account, which I cannot withdraw because, where I live, transferring money from abroad is extremely complicated.

I would like to know if anyone here is aware of a service where I can buy real stocks (not CFDs) from abroad. Ideally, I need a platform that allows me to buy and sell without excessive fees and that provides a way to withdraw my money easily. Can I withdraw to PayPal, for example?

Thank you all for your time!



# TL;DR

I mistakenly bought RDDT as CFDs instead of real stocks on Capital.com. My profits grew, but I lost everything overnight due to the DeepSeek situation. Now, I can’t withdraw my remaining funds because of transfer restrictions in my country. I’m looking for a service that allows me to buy real stocks from abroad and withdraw my money without excessive fees. Any recommendations?

Micosoft claims that it took them 17 years of research to crack it.

Microsoft isn’t using electrons for the compute in this new chip; it’s using the Majorana particle that theoretical physicist Ettore Majorana described in 1937. Microsoft has reached this milestone by creating what it calls the “world’s first topoconductor,” a new type of material that can not only observe but also control Majorana particles to create more reliable qubits

Microsoft has helped create a new material made from indium arsenide and aluminum, and it has placed eight topological qubits on a chip that it hopes can eventually scale to 1 million.

Whatvis quantum computing? In simple terms, quantum computing harnesses the strange and powerful properties of quantum mechanics to solve problems currently beyond the reach of classical computers.

1739928696.0,1istdw7,"Bill Ackman aims to create a 'modern-day Berkshire Hathaway' through $HHH - revised proposal to acquire 10,000 new shares at $90 each","\*Please actually read the post before commenting/downvoting, this post is critical of the proposal - not in support of it.

I am a fan of Bill Ackman and closely follow his fund, Pershing Square Holdings ($PSH) which is managed by the hedge fund he founded in 2004 - Pershing Square Capital Management. Ackman is a great admirer of Warren Buffet's career and has largely based his investment approach on his teachings. In 2014, he publicly launched PSH as a closed-ended fund, the structure of which meant PSCM could manage a permanent pool of capital that wouldn't be subject to investors wanting to pull out funds due to short-term fluctuations - similar to how Buffet has a permanent pool of capital at Berkshire Hathaway.

Bill Ackman has talked about wanting to create an investment vehicle structured as a holding company, like Buffet did when he bought up a controlling stake in Berkshire Hathaway through his private partnership, before then dissolving the partnership - and leaving him as the largest owner of a public company within which he could re-invest cashflows and acquire stakes in other businesses.

Ackman's proposal to Howard Hughes Holding's ($HHH) board of directors is supposedly an attempt to create this 'modern-day Berkshire Hathaway' - which he discusses in these two X posts. The reality of the proposal, however, means this venture is starkly different from Berkshire Hathaway - and, in my opinion, Bill is disingenuously using Buffet's brand/reputation to simply attract increased AUM and profit mostly from a new revenue stream for PSCM rather than compounding shareholder value.

Important details of the proposal (you can read the full details here):

* PSCM is proposing to acquire 10,000 newly issued shares of $HHH at $90 per share, which will amount to a total cash injection of $900 million.
* HHH is the parent company of Howard Hughes Corporation, which will continue to operate as it does now as a subsidiary. Ackman/PSCM will use the $900 million, and additional free cash flow from HHC, to buy stakes in other businesses.
* Through $HHH shares, investors can own these businesses along with HHC, the same way BRK.A/B shareholders own Berkshire's subsidiaries and minority stake investments.
* However, in his posts on X, where Ackman praised Buffet and compared the proposed venture to Berkshire Hathaway, he failed to mention that his offer to $HHH includes a 1.5% annual management fee - which would be calculated as using of $HHH's equity market capitalisation.
* This means that, at the current market cap + $900 million valuation, Howard Hughes Holdings would pay \~$68 million in annual management fees to Ackman's PSCM - while PSCM would also have a \~$2.15 Billion stake in the company representing 48% ownership up from 38% currently.
* So, essentially, PSCM would be paying $468 million ($900m adjusted for 48% stake) to create a new revenue stream worth \~$68m - which is roughly an 11% yearly return on investment when deducting the $18m in fees that PSH shareholders already pay to PSCM for their shares in HHH (these fees are being eliminated so that PSH shareholders aren't paying an extra 1.5% on top of the 1.5% they already pay).
* If Ackman really wanted to follow in Buffet's footsteps, why wouldn't he ensure that his interests are in full alignment with ordinary shareholders? Why couldn't he create a holding company in some other way using PSH or PSCM?

(NASDAQ: META) is poised to conclude its unprecedented 20-day winning streak, with shares currently down 3.8% at $708.25. This rally, the longest among S&P 500 companies since at least 1980, began on January 16, 2025.  ￼


The surge in stock price has been underpinned by strong financial results for both the fourth quarter (Q4) and full fiscal year 2024 (FY2024). Key highlights includes revenue growth in Q4 reaching $48.39 billion, a 21% increase year-over-year, while FY2024 revenue totaled $164.50 billion, up 22% from the previous year.  ￼


Q4 net income was $20.84 billion, a 49% increase compared to the same period last year. For FY2024, net income stood at $62.36 billion, marking a 59% increase.  ￼
Q4 diluted EPS was $8.02, up 50% year-over-year.
The annual EPS for FY2024 was $23.86, reflecting a 60% surge.  ￼


CEO Mark Zuckerberg attributed this growth to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) glasses, and the evolution of social media platforms. He expressed enthusiasm for scaling these efforts further in 2025.  ￼


Looking ahead, Meta anticipates Q1 2025 revenue between $39.5 billion and $41.8 billion, representing 8-15% year-over-year growth. The company also projects full-year 2025 expenses to range from $114 billion to $119 billion, primarily driven by infrastructure investments and employee compensation in key areas such as AI and Reality Labs.  ￼


Despite the potential end to the current stock rally, Meta’s strong financial performance and strategic investments position the company for continued growth-- last but not least, despite the end of its winning streak... the stock is still up a f**king 18% YEAR-TO-DATE.

**Catalyst:** Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, has unveiled its latest model, Grok-3, claiming it surpasses competitors like GPT-4o, Google Gemini, DeepSeek V3, and Claude.

These assertions have not been independently verified by the open sourcen community but it wouldn't be surprising if it could surpass 4o (the model is close to a year old now)

**Technicals:** No real level I've been watching in NVDA, already positioned long. Note that xAI uses NVDA GPU's specifically in their super computer.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** We've seen a very strong recovery since the Deepseek fears caused a selloff. Personally I don't think xAI will cause the same effect that Deepseek did, but I think that the semis are a winner of this again.

**Risks:** Unverified performance claims may lead to skepticism among investors and potential customers, impacting adoption rates and market trust. XAI has a “Colossus supercomputer,” for training AI, which it said last year was utilizing a cluster of 100,000 advanced Nvidia GPUs for AI training.

Today, the company revealed that it doubled the size of its GPU cluster for the training of Grok 3.

**Catalyst:** HEES has confirmed a $105 per share acquisition offer from Herc Rentals, surpassing the previous $92 per share bid from United Rentals.

**Technicals:** Watching $100 level. They've accepted the bid so we might see trading closer to that bid price in the near future.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Equipment rental industry is witnessing consolidation due to decelerating growth since 2023 (other than that nothing explosive)

**Risks:** The bidding war may escalate acquisition costs, potentially leading to overvaluation and financial strain for the acquiring company.

**Catalyst:** Nike has announced a new brand collaboration with SKIMS, launching a line called NikeSKIMS.

**Technicals:** Watching $75 level.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SKIMS is pretty popular- mainly does underwear/loungewear/shapewear but this might be more focused on athleisure. This could potentially make a difference in NKE sales- SKIMS also collaborated with The North Face in the past, so worth keeping track of this for future catalysts in case they work with other brands.

**Catalyst:** Unconfirmed reports suggest that President Trump plans to demand $500 billion from Ukraine and seek U.S. control over the country's mineral resources.

These claims have not been reported by major U.S. news outlets but have appeared in international media (from India, Canada, UK)

**Technicals:** This catalyst has been ""semi-leaked"" for the past week but not ""fully confirmed"", but we would likely see a selloff in defense stocks if true.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** These companies would go to the downside from an end to the Ukraine war, and spike if talks aren't successful.

**Risks:** Pretty much a ""wait for the news announcement"" kind of trade, pretty straightforward.

**Catalyst:** BIDU earnings with an EPS of ¥19.18 vs ¥14.13. Revenue of ¥34.1 billion vs ¥33.4 billion.

The company noted a 178% quarter-over-quarter increase in external API calls for its ERNIE AI bot and expects its AI investments to deliver more significant results in 2025.

Additionally, A.G. (their driverless car unit) has commenced 100% fully driverless operations across China since February.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The China techsector has been pretty competitive in AI and autonomous driving tech. Something interesting over the weekend was Xi meeting with private sector business leaders, signaling that China would be more friendly to business leaders (like Jack Ma)

**Risks:** It's China.

1.**Fixed Investment in U.S. Treasury Bills:** Allocate $200,000 to short-term U.S. Treasury bills, with any excess funds used for long-term investments.

2.**Investing in 2800.HK:** Buy a certain amount of [2800.HK](http://2800.HK) and use the annual dividends to fund other long-term investments.

3.**Balancing Treasury and Long-Term Investments:** Instead of putting the full $200,000 into U.S. Treasury bills initially, allocate more funds to long-term investments first, and increase low-risk investments later if profits are made.

Given my current level of commitment to investing, it might be wise to sell some individual stocks at high points and reinvest in index funds or strong companies.

Right now, I have a significant portion of my funds in U.S. Treasury bills, but this has made me overly sensitive to market fluctuations. If I were to invest everything into a strong asset, I might be able to eliminate this sense of unease.

Back in 2022, during the Hong Kong stock market crash, I nearly went all-in on [2800.HK](http://2800.HK), but I didn’t hold onto the long-term investment. I wonder if another opportunity will arise to buy in at a low price again.

Meanwhile, US pension funds continue increasing exposure to AI, recognizing its transformative potential and long-term growth. This divergence means that millions of Europeans relying on their pensions risk missing out on one of the most significant investment opportunities in decades.

With over $500 billion in assets and coverage of one in six Dutch citizens, ABP’s decision has far-reaching implications.

Intel, once the indomitable titan of the chip-making world, has been struggling to maintain its dominance and is now considering a major division. Broadcom is eyeing Intel’s chip design and marketing division, while TSMC is poised to take over Intel’s manufacturing arm. This potential dismantling could align Intel with the growing industry trend where companies focus on either designing or manufacturing chips, but not both.

It’s incredible to think that a company as big and important as Intel, a name synonymous with innovation and technological advancement, is now facing such a drastic fate. One day, it was the undisputed leader in the semiconductor industry, and the next day, it looks like it might be divided and taken over. The market tilt is indeed ruthless.

The discussions are still in the early stages, and no formal offers have been made yet. However, Intel’s recent tribulations, including falling behind TSMC in advanced chip production and the abrupt departure of CEO Pat Gelsinger, have left it in a vulnerable position.

It's fascinating to witness how the landscape of the semiconductor industry might shift if this deal goes through. What do you all think about this potential carve-up? Do you believe it will spell the end of an era for Intel, or could this be the rebirth it desperately needs?",65,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1irey65/broadcom_and_tsmc_in_talks_to_carve_up_intels/

Nothing. No rationale, not even a crackpot theory (At least I wasn't able to find one).

1739694990.0,1iqny2q,"Apple, amazing company that’s I just can't bring myself to buy","Apple is the world’s most valuable company, the most beloved consumer brand, and the best-run capital return machine in the modern stock market. It has survived every bear thesis, adapted to every challenge, and delivered shareholders a relentless stream of buybacks, dividends, and steady earnings growth.

At 33x forward earnings, the market is pricing Apple as if it will continue this dominance indefinitely. But no company can defy gravity forever. Apple’s next phase of growth depends on emerging markets, where its traditional advantages—brand strength, pricing power, and ecosystem lock-in—are not guaranteed to work the same way they have in the U.S. and Europe.

Much like a perfectly applied face of makeup, Apple looks flawless at first glance. But take a closer look, and a few cracks start to appear. Buybacks are masking slowing earnings growth. Services margins, long assumed to be unassailable, are under regulatory threat. And in markets where Apple is banking on its next wave of users, it’s facing competition from companies that know these regions better and are playing an entirely different game.

The market assumes Apple will extend its dominance effortlessly. The data suggests otherwise.

# The Market Assumes the iPhone Will Conquer Everywhere. That’s a Risky Bet.

In North America, Apple’s pricing power is sacred. In emerging markets, it is anything but.

Apple’s dominance in the U.S. is built on two things: a premium brand and a seamless ecosystem. People don’t leave iOS because switching out of iMessage, AirDrop, and the App Store is a hassle. But in places like India, Latin America, and Africa, the default phone isn’t an iPhone. It’s an Android device, often made by Xiaomi, OPPO, or Transsion, where users have already built their own ecosystems of digital services.

That’s a problem for Apple’s long-term growth. If users in these markets don’t start on iOS, they aren’t going to be locked into Apple’s ecosystem later. And in the places where Apple is growing, it’s often doing so by selling older iPhones at discounted prices—an approach that works for market share but erodes the premium pricing model that has sustained its margins.

Apple is winning some battles, but at what cost?

* **Latin America**: iPhone shipments jumped 21% year-over-year in 2024, but most of that growth came from discounted older models and local assembly in Brazil to avoid import tariffs. The broader smartphone market in the region grew 10% in the same period. That means Apple isn’t necessarily taking over—it’s just keeping up by cutting prices. Meanwhile, Xiaomi continues to outsell Apple, offering comparable hardware at a fraction of the price.
* **India**: Apple is making its biggest push yet, opening flagship stores in Mumbai and Delhi, ramping up local manufacturing, and introducing aggressive financing options. Morgan Stanley estimates India will account for 15% of Apple’s revenue growth over the next five years. But the market reality is stark: iOS has less than 11% market share, and the vast majority of smartphones sold in India cost under $300. Apple has already had to cut iPhone 15 prices shortly after launch due to weak demand. If Apple is forced to compete on price in India, it risks undermining its premium brand without capturing users who will spend heavily on services later.
* **Africa**: Apple has barely made a dent. iOS accounts for just 13% of smartphone OS usage on the continent, where Transsion dominates by offering localized software, low prices, and an understanding of informal distribution channels that Apple simply doesn’t have. There is no clear path for Apple to break into the mass market in Africa without fundamentally changing its business model.
* **China**: The country that once seemed like Apple’s second home is becoming more difficult. Huawei’s resurgence in 2024 cut into Apple’s iPhone sales, forcing Apple to offer rare price cuts on iPhones and Macs. That’s a red flag—Apple has built its entire business on not needing to lower prices to stimulate demand.

The big takeaway is that Apple’s expansion into emerging markets is not coming from a position of strength. The company is selling more phones, but only by making pricing concessions. The North American investor base, still anchored to the idea that Apple can charge whatever it wants, may not be fully appreciating what this means for long-term margins.

# Apple’s Valuation Assumes Its Services Model Works Everywhere. That’s Not a Given.

Apple is no longer just a hardware company—at least, that’s the argument bulls have made for the past five years. With nearly $90 billion in annual revenue, Apple’s Services business is treated as the company’s long-term growth engine, the high-margin hedge against slowing hardware sales.

But Services growth depends on Apple’s ability to monetize its installed base at the same high rates it does in the U.S. and Europe. That assumption is now running into regulatory roadblocks.

* The EU’s Digital Markets Act (2024-2025) will force Apple to allow third-party app stores and alternative payment systems.
* India, South Korea, and Japan are introducing similar measures.
* The DOJ and FTC in the U.S. are escalating scrutiny on Apple’s App Store model.

The App Store has historically operated with 70-80% operating margins, making it one of the most profitable businesses in the world. But if Apple is forced to cut its 30% commission on in-app purchases or allow competing app stores on iOS, that margin could start to shrink.

Investors have priced Apple as if its Services business will continue expanding indefinitely. But they may be underestimating how much of that growth has been built on monopolistic practices that regulators are now actively dismantling.

# Margins Are Peaking, and Buybacks Are Holding Up the Stock—For Now.

Apple’s gross margin hit a record 47% in 2024, thanks to a greater mix of Services revenue and cost efficiencies in hardware production. But the factors that have driven margin expansion over the past decade are starting to reverse.

* Price sensitivity in emerging markets means Apple may have to sell lower-cost iPhones, reducing hardware margins.
* Regulatory risks to the App Store mean Services margins could compress.
* China’s slowing demand threatens Apple’s most profitable international market.

Meanwhile, Apple’s capital return strategy is doing much of the heavy lifting for its stock price. The company generates over $90 billion in free cash flow annually and spends nearly all of it on buybacks, helping to sustain EPS growth even as revenue growth slows. Without buybacks, Apple’s true earnings trajectory would look much less impressive.

# When Does Apple Become a Buy?

Apple is a great business, but at 33x forward earnings, it should be too rich for most investors. I believe it can become a great business at a great price through one of mechanisms:

* Multiple compression below 20x earnings.
* A regulatory overreaction that temporarily depresses the stock beyond actual impact.
* A broad macro selloff that ignores Apple’s cash-generating ability.

Apple is priced as if its growth story will continue uninterrupted. But in emerging markets, competition is tougher, and pricing power is weaker. The Services business, which has carried Apple’s margins, is now facing existential regulatory threats. Buybacks are keeping the stock afloat, but they can only do so much. Apple will still be a great business in five years. But is it a great stock at today’s price? I don't think it is.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I’m new to equity analysis and have put together the above deep dive on Apple’s valuation, particularly its challenges in emerging markets and risks to services growth. Please let me know what you think about Apple's share price and future.

I work on these memos for my own personal investments. I hold Apple indirectly through VGT.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates Apple is a weaker equity than people might think —Apple’s future growth relies on price-sensitive markets where it lacks its usual pricing power, while services, its high-margin growth driver, faces regulatory threats. Without a new major revenue stream, growth looks constrained. Management has a strong track record of launching successful businesses, but at 33x forward earnings believing they’ll pull something new out of the hat requires a leap of faith.",0,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1iqny2q/apple_amazing_company_thats_i_just_cant_bring/

Without regulatory guardrails, financial institutions might take on excessive risk, leveraging new derivatives and unstable assets. Deregulated markets have historically encouraged reckless speculation, leading to unsustainable bubbles. If one major player collapses, the domino effect could trigger an economic disaster, potentially deeper than the Great Recession.

In such a scenario, it won’t be the billionaires or corporations suffering the most—it will be the middle class. A job market crash, evaporating pensions, and inflationary aftershocks could leave workers in an even more precarious position, with fewer rights than ever before.

**Is the market sleepwalking into another crisis?**

I know predicting a market top and a potential crisis is easy, and many have done it before... but with the rise of **an unelected CEO** at the head of the **D.O.G.E.**, aiming to **dismantle the education system, deregulate labor laws**, and **remove financial and economic safeguards**, are we *underestimating* the scale of the coming storm?

1739634052.0,1iq409q,Holding TSLA and PLTR.. am I an idiot?,"Hey everyone, torn between what to do here. 

I’m 29 and have about 800K in net worth (about 770K invested across brokerage/retirement accounts. 

The majority is in VOO (about 500K) - but I have about 150K in TSLA (100%+ gains) and 100K in PLTR (400% gains). 

One side of me is thinking to sell about half of each and move it into VOO and chill. The other side, has so much belief in TSLA and PLTR for the next 5-10 years, I want to hold and see where it goes. Deciding whether to play it safer, or really go for it. I just want me and my wife to retire early 😭 

Curious to what ya’ll would do in my case. Thanks!

1739631362.0,1iq31po,CSCO AI Data Centers Are Booming—Who’s Supplying the Backbone?,"Big analyst upgrades following strong earnings signal bullish momentum for Cisco (CSCO). The stock is positioned to capitalize on a massive global infrastructure buildout, yet its call options still appear undervalued compared to industry peers. I’ve been adding to my position this week, as CSCO looks primed for a breakout.

Over the past two years, the level of innovation, product development, and strategic partnerships has been incredible. Do your own research… but I’m looking for the next trillion-dollar company, and I believe they have the potential.

As companies scale AI networks and build data centers, demand for **high-performance networking, switching, and routing hardware** is set to surge. While **NVIDIA (NVDA)** dominates AI chips, the real infrastructure winners will also include companies supplying the backbone to support these workloads.  Their new high-capacity cables (450V, touch-safe, ground-safe, and easy to deploy) could be a game-changer for AI infrastructure. Cisco showcased this tech at its **2025 Amsterdam event**, highlighting its scalability for AI-driven data center expansion.

Check out their YouTube videos from **Cisco Live 2025** and their partnership with **Dakota State University**, a leader in AI, quantum computing, and cybersecurity. CSCO is helping standardize their infrastructure—exactly what enterprises need as they scale next-gen AI infrastructure investments.

Another thought for Cisco? Much of its competition—like **Huawei and TP-Link**—comes from China, where security risks and trade restrictions could give CSCO a strong positioning in Western markets.

Cisco just hit its 52-week high on Friday—curious to hear your thoughts, do you think there's more upside from here?",24,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1iq31po/csco_ai_data_centers_are_boomingwhos_supplying/
