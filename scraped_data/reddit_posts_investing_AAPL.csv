1740262238.0,1ivuig5,Time to exit or trim my positions?,"I've done very well the past three years, more than doubleing my investment through stock positions.  I only have one index fund (SMIN) which is a small cap India fund, but it's one of three positions not doing well.  I have many others doing well with 30-80% gains.  My biggest gains have come from NVDA and PLTR which were up over 900 & 600% until this past week.  

Going into this week I had a sense that the market was overvalued and with the current administration, I don't feel there is certaintly (I know there never is but there is more turmoil recently) about the future of the market and economy.  I really feel we are on the cusp of a significant downturn in the market and the ecomomic outlook is negative and very uncertain.

What are everyone's thought about these next few weeks?  I think with the turmoil that the current adminstration is causing, its not going to bode well for the economy and the market.

I have a little cash in my Fidelity account but thinking of significantly trimming or exiting my positons to have cash to take advantage of the bargains that I think will exist in the coming months. If I do this the gains are long term and will likely push me up into a couple knotches of tax brackets.

1740201940.0,1ivbhvr,Here is why stocks beat rentals,"Today I was visiting the different rentals I have and while in the car did a lot of analyzing rentals versus stocks. Since the topic comes up frequently I will give my thoughts. 

Example rental I have. $40k purchase price, $750/mo rent. This is a great deal by all metrics. This is essentially a 2% rule deal which is unheard of.

Taxes $100/mo, insurance $100/mo, maintenance $100/mo, lawn care and miscellaneous $100/mo. Anyone who knows Realestate knows $100 a month doesn’t really cover major capex but let’s go with it. 

Net is essentially $350/mo or about $4k a year on $40k. 10% not bad. I can probably increase rent 5% a year, the property will increase 5% a year. and let’s say I hold for 30 years. 

After 30 years I made give or take $200k in rent and the property is worth $165k. And my annual rent will be about $18k now. 


$40k in BTI stock right now would pay you $3,200 a year in dividends. If you reinvest all dividends for 30y, they increase dividends 5% and the share appreciates 3%…

My shares are worth $234k, I made a total of $155k in dividends, I’m receiving $24k annually from dividends. 

A few things not taken into consideration include the ability to use leverage which can increase returns but also increase risk, alternatively the work required to maintain a rental. No management fees have been included as well. 

Now take all this into consideration, the likelihood or effort of finding a 2% deal, the work required, the liquidity of both, and the fact that I didn’t account for major capex and you can clearly see which is the better option.

Any insight on risks/negatives (high expense rates, impact on upside, etc.) would be much appreciated. I’m not looking to argue about where the market is headed as I shall not be moved!

Also Republicans (and Trump) are notorious De-regulators so I see companies eventually being mostly optimistic once we get out of this initial downturn.  Unfortunately, the Walmart’s of the world tend to temporarily drive market sentiment.  But I am not worried in the long-run once this initial period of bluster and uncertainty go away.

1740165173.0,1iuyzsv,Thoughts on a unique situation?,"Let's say my wife (early 30's) has a bit of money in an inherited IRA from her father. Because it's an ""inherited"" account, she can draw from it without paying penalties, but it is not a Roth so she will have to pay normal income tax on any withdrawals. She also cannot make any further contributions to the account. 

Now, we are rather low earners. Around $60k/yr together so we don't even fill the 12% tax bracket. I was considering pros and cons to slowly moving some of this account into a brokerage account, or a Roth IRA if possible. Looking at the long term capital gains tax brackets, it's unlikely we would pay much, if any, tax on withdrawals from the brokerage account during retirement since the the 0% long term capital gains tax bracket reaches nearly $100k when filling joint. 

If we did this, we would pay taxes now on whatever we move so there's less money to grow, but less taxes paid later (leaving us with slightly more money according to some quick estimated calculations). However, if we decided for any reason to change up allocations, there would be tax implications at that time. We keep most of our portfolio in the S&P 500 and have no plans to change that anytime soon, but it's worth considering. 

If we leave it as is and just let it grow, we pay nothing now, but full income tax rates in retirement. It also allows us to buy and sell within the account, if we decided to do so, without tax implications.

1740148499.0,1iusau4,Revised Long-Term Leveraged ETF Strategy (200k€ Initial Investment),"Hello everyone! After analyzing various approaches and considering risk management, I'd like to share my refined investment strategy. This plan aims to balance leverage, growth potential, and portfolio stability over a 20+ year horizon.

Initial Portfolio Structure (200k€ Lumpsum)

* MIVU:FR (Amundi MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Factor UCITS): 35% (70k€) Core stability position providing lower volatility exposure to U.S. equities
* CL2:FR (Amundi 2x Leveraged MSCI USA UCITS ETF): 22.5% (45k€)
* LQQ:FR (Lyxor 2x Leveraged Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF): 22.5% (45k€) Combined 45% in 2x leveraged ETFs for enhanced market exposure
* PE500:FR (Amundi S&P 500 UCITS ETF): 10% (20k€)
* PANX:FR (Amundi Nasdaq-100 UCITS ETF): 10% (20k€) Traditional ETFs for additional stability

Monthly Investment Plan & Leverage Strategy Starting with an initial portfolio leverage of 1.45x ((90k€ × 2 + 110k€) / 200k€), I'll be investing 1,500€/month exclusively into leveraged ETFs (split 50/50 between CL2 and LQQ). Through these monthly contributions, I aim to reach a target leverage of 1.6x in approximately 93 months (7.75 years). This approach relies entirely on fresh capital without selling any existing positions.

After the 93 months, I will exclusively invest in low-volatility S&P 500 or MSCI USA, depending on what is available at the time. If, by then, I have access to a 2x leveraged low-volatility ETF for the USA or even the world, I will allocate all my investments to that option.

Risk Management & Long-Term Approach The strategy maintains Min Vol as a permanent core (35%) to provide portfolio stability and reduce sequence risk. This, combined with the 20% allocation to non-leveraged ETFs, creates a strong foundation while still allowing for enhanced returns through leveraged exposure. The gradual increase in leverage through monthly contributions, rather than immediate reallocation, helps manage risk and reduce timing pressure.

Key Strategy Components:

* Initial leverage: 1.45x
* Target leverage: 1.6x (reached through monthly contributions)
* Timeline: \~93 months to reach target leverage
* Min Vol permanent allocation: 35%
* No selling of existing positions
* Pure contribution strategy: 1,500€/month to leveraged ETFs

Would love to hear your thoughts on this approach, particularly regarding:

1. The timeline to reach 1.6x leverage
2. The decision to maintain permanent Min Vol exposure
3. The monthly contribution strategy versus more aggressive reallocation
4. Do you think I should replace MSCI USA Minimum Volatility with NTSX ?

47 yoa - moved during the start of the last housing bubble so locked in 30 yr fixed 4.5 with 0.25% discount… essentially 4.25%.   Pay Off at 73 years of age.   Want to retire around 55.   

Parents want to give us $400,000 (200 each) to do with what we want.   I kidda don’t want to pay a mortgage until I’m 77 years old when I’m retiring at 55.   The 400,000 would be half of our current mortgage.  

I already have a 403b, and 457 that i was funding with hopes to use its tax free growth to pay off some mortgage when we retire.  Maxing Roth IRA for the last 15 years as well.

Would you:
1.  Make one big lump sum payment on house now and have the house paid off in 11 years (in time for retirement) 
2.  Buy government 10 year at 4.6%
3.  Invest in something with dividend
4.  Take 2 or 3 and use the divided or extra money paid to pay down mortgage as you go (should help pay 3 months per year at 4.5%)
5.  Other ideas?

Already have 1 year emergency fund and no debt other than mortgage… 4 kids who will most likely go to college but 529’s are funded pretty well for all 4.   I’m not sure why people downvoted my lack of risk tolerance for this money… very odd but ok.    Not sure if this changes things or people’s opinions but i did not think about the tax consequences of the 400 k.   

Option 6:   Due to taxes, i like the idea of a trust that someone suggested… maybe the 400k stays with my parents, they put it into a trust that pays out 18k to us per year and we just take the 18 k and put it to the mortgage.   The trust would have to make 4.5% to pay indefinitely, more to grow….

And now the carry trade in Turkey scenario. I send the money to my bank account in TR. I pay a miniscule amount for the transfer. I convert the money to TRY. The spread is very high between buying and selling rates, around 5%. I have €95.000 now. The yearly interest rate for time deposit is 40%. Let’s just say, 10% for 3 months. I keep the money for that period, get an extra €9.500, pay the %15 tax and just piss off with my €8.075. 

I know there is currency risk. But TRY had been stable for the last 6 months now and there are reasons for the government to try to keep it stable for another few months. So, let’s just say I believe the currency will be stable during this period and the risk, I’m willing to take. 

What else stops me from carry trading? There should surely be something I’m missing, right? Else everyone would be doing it. Please just talk me out of it.",6,30,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iumr84/carry_trading_in_turkey_what_are_the_risks_or/

I am also impressed with how they fake the data to make it seem like historically they're in a huge plus while every time I start looking is just the moment they suddenly start losing.

Well, we had quite a good run up to yesterday so I'll make a cut there since the vast majority of the stocks fell. This was not scientific at all, it's an average of 16 transactions per each name and I just bought everything they like and sold if they said so.

The names are just the first random stuff I could gather on investing subreddits.

Paul Thomas Investing - down 7.5 %. These are usually just stocks in freefall, I reckon they down 75% when I glance back but I had a 7% stop loss so they stopped at 7.5 haha

WallStreetZen - down 3.75 %

Zacks Ultimate (was on trial for cheap) - down 2.36 %  
Just gathering info from the articles rather than following investors seems to net much better results and is slightly in the plus.

AfterHour - down 2.07 %. Would be down way more if I didn't choose and pick hard what people and advice to follow. Got a 25% win with PLTR (smth I actually bought with real money), so I guess that's something.

Prospero ai - down 1.64 %

My weekly stock - down 1.30 %

Seeking alpha - down 0.43 % - almost not losing money at this point, impressive!  


Next step, testing in a bear market. I mean, I'm not gonna do it, but I have a feeling it does not look pretty.

Beyond that, I find things become cumbersome as to what to do. A lot of people have many different goals. In this forum everyone likes to invest every additional dollar. 

But, for some, it’s a down payment on a rental property, others, it’s buying land, or it may be paying off a 7% mortgage. All of these items I just mentioned could require $50-500,000 in cash quite quickly.. So, while you “wait” to find a real estate deal, do you throw your extra $200k into the markets and risk losing 20% at any moment? Or keep it in a HYSA? Is it a smart move to invest money for a questionable amount of time in the S&P? Like a buffed up savings account, just invested…?

1740096283.0,1iudhgs,Bumble ($BMBL) Looks Incredibly Cheap for a Profitable $1B+ Revenue Company—Is the Market Sleeping on It?,"I’ve been looking at Bumble ($BMBL) recently, and the valuation seems completely misaligned with its fundamentals. Right now, it’s trading **below $600M market cap**, despite generating **$1B+ in annual revenue and being cash flow positive**.

A few key points that make this interesting:

1️⃣ **The Valuation Gap vs. Match Group ($MTCH) is Absurd**

* Match Group does **$3.4B in annual revenue** and is valued at **$8.4B (\~2.5x revenue).**
* Bumble does **\~$1B in revenue** but is valued at **\~$600M (\~0.6x revenue).**
* If Bumble were valued similarly to Match, it would be worth **\~$2.5B ($20+/share)**—**4x its current price.**

2️⃣ **Not a Cash-Burning Growth Stock—It’s Profitable**

* Bumble is **cash flow positive** and not dependent on outside funding.
* This isn’t a struggling tech startup—it’s a real business with **strong user engagement**.

3️⃣ **The Founder Is Returning as CEO**

* Whitney Wolfe Herd (Bumble’s original founder) is coming back in March.
* She was **instrumental in launching Tinder** and then built Bumble into a major competitor.
* Founder-led companies often perform better, especially in **turnaround scenarios** (think Howard Schultz at Starbucks, Steve Jobs at Apple).

4️⃣ **Clear Path to Unlocking Value**

* **Cost-cutting and layoffs** to improve profitability.
* **New marketing strategies** and product features.
* **Potential M&A target**—this is a reasonable acquisition target at current levels.

# Why is it so cheap?

* The **post-IPO hype collapsed**, and dating app sentiment is weak.
* The market seems to **overlook its profitability and brand strength**.
* Investors might be **assuming user growth is permanently stalled**, but that seems overly pessimistic.

At this price, it looks like a **high-reward, low-risk play**—either it rerates higher, or a larger company scoops it up.

Would love to hear thoughts—does this look like **deep value** or a **value trap**?",0,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1iudhgs/bumble_bmbl_looks_incredibly_cheap_for_a/

Or start stock piling dividend stocks now? I realize that you can't give me financial advice, etc...

For a long time, I had a chunk invested in VUSTX Vanguard Long Term Treasury Fund.  I took an overdue look at this, and it has done awfully, meaning negative returns.  Any suggestions for the best place to put bond funds to reduce my risk while still maintaining a positive return?",4,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ity898/how_should_i_invest_in_bonds_for_my_retirement/

1740051365.0,1itwhf6,Help Investing / Self Employed,"Hi everyone, I own my own business (sole prop) s-corp moving forward and it makes between 10-25k+ per month in profit. 2025 will be my second full year. With that said in the prior years of working, I’ve managed to save up $160k and it’s all in a HYSA. I have no retirement at the moment & 23 y/o. 0 debt 770+ credit. 

I have a few options. 

- I can pay 11k in Taxes for 2024 
- I can contribute 30k to retirement account and only pay around 3k in taxes 
- Somewhere in between 

I’m having a hard time deciding because I want to buy a house this year and closing costs, + down payment on the high end are about 40-50k but closer to 40k. With additional costs such as any renovations/paint/etc maybe 20k. 

Can you give me some advice as I don’t really know what to do in my situation. What should I be doing differently going forward. ",5,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1itwhf6/help_investing_self_employed/

1740040508.0,1ittwsw,PLTR to $20 by March? Insider Sell Window Theory,"PLTR’s sitting pretty at $100+ right now, with a 40x revenue multiple and 150x forward earnings—absolute madness. But I’ve got a wild theory I’m chewing on, and I want your take. The tea leaves (X posts, earnings vibes, random chatter) suggest the board’s pumping the stock hard—like, artificially keeping it sky-high—to set up a sweet exit window for insiders and employees. Then, bam, they let it drop once the selling’s done.Here’s the kicker: Karp’s unloading 9.975M shares through Sept 2025 (SEC filings), and the next trading window’s mid-Feb to mid-April after earnings. Stock’s got hype, but this valuation’s a house of cards—feels like they’re nudging folks to cash out now before gravity hits. I’m calling it: if they ease off the juice post-window, PLTR could crater to $20 by March 2025. That’s, what, 20x forward earnings, closer to sanity for a software play, even with their AI glow.Am I nuts? Sell with the insiders in Feb-April while it’s $100+, or is this just FUD and PLTR holds the line? Could it really hit $20 that fast if the board stops propping it up? Momentum’s real, but so’s mean reversion. What’s your play?",0,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ittwsw/pltr_to_20_by_march_insider_sell_window_theory/
