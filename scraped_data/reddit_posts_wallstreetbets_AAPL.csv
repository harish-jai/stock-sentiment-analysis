Later, I started looking at other stocks and bought a long call option for UNH. In January, I purchased a June call for $1,800 and made a $500 profit. Then, I re-entered UNH, but on earnings day, the stock dropped further, and I exited with a loss.

In February, I entered UNH again and made another $500 profit. I re-entered once more, but the stock dropped. I averaged down twice before the big drop on Friday.

Now, I am at a loss. Should I quit trading options? I am not analyzing charts; instead, I am buying calls based on the assumption that if a stock is down but the business is strong, it will recover.

1740265298.0,1ivvm3t,MRNA DD,"TLDR:  MRNA calls


What’s up guys?  I’m following up my WMT earnings play with another dip into MRNA.  I follow this stock closely and have posted about it before.  Those that tailed last time made money(although it was a painful hold).  I like MRNA because it is prone to pretty large moves, and options can gain(and lose) value very quickly. Here is why I bought calls on Friday.


1.  The big news Friday that led to a 5% jump in MRNA.   Scientists in China found a covid-like virus in bats studied in a lab.  This is significant because this virus enters the human body through a similar pathway as Covid-19.   The vast majority of coronaviruses cannot infect humans, but SARS Covid-19 and this new virus both use the same receptor to enter human cells and replicate.  This news was fairly fresh on Friday, with only a couple outlets reporting it.  I think that after a weekend of this info spreading, we will see strong buying pressure on MRNA early next week.  


2.  Avian flu is concerns are rising.  The virus is now endemic in cows and cats, showing that it is spreading within mammals.  While this has been happening for a little while and is not really new news, what’s is new is that the current administration is cutting funding for infectious disease study, and likely keeping important information from being published.  The bare minimum is available on the CDC website, a massive difference between now and 2020 when data was published daily.   This is going to get worse, and it is only a matter of time before we see human to human spreading.  When that happens MRNA will double in price, which is why longer dated calls are a good play IMO.  


3.  Big players are buying here.  Bridgewater Associates(founded by Ray Dalio), the largest hedge fund in the world by AUM, just bought 600,000+ shares, Theleme Partners now owns $300 million worth, and Jane Street just upped their holdings to $150 million.  Book value for MRNA is right around $30.  We saw them miss on EPS but beat on revs recently.  That morning, the stock very briefly dropped to $28, but was bought back up to $33 almost instantly.  In my opinion, $30 is the floor.   It may come down and test it again, but I doubt it given the news Friday.   IF MRNA breaks $30 and closes below $30 on significant volume, I will likely abandon this thesis and consider it a lost cause. 


4.  The technicals are very bullish.  There is a significant bullish RSI divergence on both the daily and the weekly(yes I drew a line on the RSI).  MACD is turning up on both time frames as well.  This is the exact same RSI setup that helped me see the WMT pivot last week.  I know it’ll get ragged on here, but it helps me spot reversals so I add it to the list of clues.  


5.  The options chain.  The put/call volume ratio for next week is 0.10.  For those that don’t know, that means 10 times as many call options were traded as put options.  The open interest put/call ratio is 0.65, still very bullish.   The one caveat to the volume is one trader may have entered a large call credit spread, which would be bearish, but it could also be a hedge.  HOWEVER, there will still be about 78,000 open call contracts between $35 and $41 that could act as a magnet.  There are also around 58,000 call options in open interest at the $45 and $50 strikes for March 21.  Those are a bit safer and I will likely roll some of my already purchased weeklies into those. 


6.  Volume.  It’s been elevated since November.  In the early Covid days, MRNA would regularly get 20-40 million share days.  Towards the end of 2021 until Nov 2024, the average day would be between 2-6 million shares or so.  In the last week, volume has not dipped below 10 million, and hit 21 million shares on Friday.  


I think MRNA is gearing up for a move to the upside.  I have $40 and $41 calls expiring this week, but I will roll them to a later date if I think it’s appropriate. Quick note, MRNA tends to run really hard in one direction in the first 10 minutes of trading.  That direction is usually a fake out, and it often reverse very quickly.  Again, it’s prone to very large, very fast moves.   Know your risk tolerance.  If you catch 100% gains at open and want to bail, do it.  If you’re down 50%, don’t panic.  


Two earnings plays that I’m looking at are HD puts(similar theory to my WMT DD) or possibly LOW puts to play for sympathy without the IV crush,  and CLF calls.  


None of this is financial advice.

**$CSL (CSL:ASX)**

Because i'm a regarded Aussie, but tendies are tendies. If this strain is half as bad as the RDDT Put guy's timing, CSL's reaches the moon before LUNR.

**Catalysts:** Partnerships with governments, and increased demand for plasma therapies due to a potential public health emergency if this Covid-like virus breaks out of the lab in Wuhan (sound familiar?).

**Risks:** If this virus turns out to be limper than Bezos's cock, then the stock might move slower than a checkout aisle at Costco.

1740258584.0,1ivt5ui,The sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger but not like how that last regard explained it,"A few hours ago I saw some regard posting[ \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1iuykwm/the_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_but/) on the mining industry gassing up regarded metals like lithium and rare earths. I'm going to attempt to explain to you regards why gold and silver mines print money and critical minerals projects are critically regarded.

**Rare Earths**

Rare earths are not rare! The main payable metal is NdPr Neodymium Praseodymium used for magnets. With Neodymium prices in the toilet due to China doing China things like injecting ammonium sulfate directly into the ground to leach the rare earths in situ, most hard rock projects like MP materials are losing money.

There are some great ionic clay rare earth projects out there with over 2% rare earth oxides but they exist on non freedom exchanges like the TSX and the ASX and are development projects that aren't mining anything yet.

The key issue with rare earths is processing capacity. This will probably get on-shored to the US in the next 5-10 years and China and Lynas Rare Earths will no longer be the only processors. This is why UUUU is the least regarded investment OP listed. DYODD.

**Lithium**

There was never a shortage of lithium, only a shortage of lithium processing capacity. Any deposit under 1% lithium is not going to be economic. Lithium is about as rare as copper. Guys at Exxon are developing direct lithium extraction technologies to extract lithium directly out of saltwater wells in [Arkansas](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/news/news-releases/2023/1113_exxonmobil-drilling-first-lithium-well-in-arkansas).

If they figure that out most existing hard rock mines may no longer be economical. Lithium is the most regarded bet. Any decent lithium project worth anything got built in the last few years.

**Gold and Silver**

We are in the beginning of a precious metals bull market. Any regard can see this in the gold chart. Historically silver prices tend to follow gold prices, but silver moons harder than gold does because the average regard is too poor to buy gold.

Gold is what central banks buy when their butt holes start to pucker. And they have been buying gold at record levels recently.

GDX and GDXJ are terrible bets because most gold companies are trash. Barrick was producing 5 million ounces 10 years ago now they're down to 2 million ounces. Nemont did so many acquisitions in the past 20 years ballooning its share count offsetting any kind of rise in profits or production they might have experienced. These companies have ruined the reputation of the mining sector for most institutions and retail investors.

It's best to bet on mid tier producers that are building or developing new mines.

They are supporting NASA’s Artemis program (for exploration, research, building infrastructures and digital lunar communications), and are notably partnered with Nokia to deploy the first cellular network on the Moon during the upcoming IM-2 mission.

Let's now see what happened to their stock price during their first mission.

* February 15, 2024: Intuitive Machines' first Moon mission, IM-1 (Nova-C lunar lander). Over the course of four days since launch date LUNR stock rose \~150%.

Second Lunar Mission is scheduled to launch as soon as Feb 26th, and we may experience a new cycle of strong valorization, starting next week. Especially as we are now facing a one month correction since 24th January that brought the stock from peaks of $25 into current lows of $18, where we see strong support on the EMA 200 in the daily chart.

TL;DR: Expect a strong rise in LUNR stock price next week in anticipation to the Second Lunar Mission launch scheduled to Feb 26th (they may move dates if any unexpected meteorological event happens).

1740179716.0,1iv4q30,DD Droneshield: tendies are printing and WSB is not even joining the party?!,"Hello Regards,

Droneshield (DRO) is showing promising returns and WSB seems unaware. A quick search on google trends would make it seem that the USA are not aware of the stock at the moment. So here is a small DD to get this beauty of a company on your radar and not leave all the tendies to the Germans and Australians. 

  
Plain and simple:

DRO develops and sells anti-drone tech. DRO engineers, produces and maintains their own products. 

Costumers: EU countries that are ramping up their drone defense systems since Ukraine has demonstrated the dangers of drones. Countries neighboring China since they also can't keep their drones to themselves. South American countries that are trying to counter the use of drones by the drug cartels.

Added value: Their products protect and save lives.

[Their revenue is ramping up with repeat orders by satisfied customers.](https://preview.redd.it/zp0bc0imhkke1.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc4cd9e2d400ab64f4fdeee2bcf84c4b8293e514)

.

[They manage to maintain super healthy gross profit margins.](https://preview.redd.it/oy2dheyyhkke1.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfcdc462de4e6c547a8c3325948efb6256ba61bd)

.

[Net profit margin transitioned into the green. ](https://preview.redd.it/hrvdph1qikke1.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=596bfe90e67ba299511afd52132c499501c31797)

Why is the net profit margin relatively low: 200 of their 255 employees are engineers that R&D this company to perfection. My guess is that this is quite expensive. Droneshield understands: great value comes from great products. And great products bring in great costumers.

  
Here is a page out of their latest earnings report. This update caused the reverse of the trend. It shows that their revenue spike was not a one off event but only the beginning of the profitable era. Read the full report here: [https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C\_4Q24.pdf](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/660a32624c94dd36e509baf3/t/67995f878b0b2b6c9b290038/1738104717089/4C_4Q24.pdf)

Negative: DRO takes on very little debt, to little. Instead they have gradually over the years sold more shares. I would say this should slow down now cash is coming in through sales. 

  
Furthermore they maintain a very healthy balance sheet with 220 million cash balance. Check out their website. Its a piece of art on its own: [https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations](https://www.droneshield.com/investor-relations)

I plan to stay in for the long run. But if it moons again like last time I will take profit and step back in when the dust settled. 

There is a lot more to be said about this company. But I leave that for the discussion. I hope I have been of service to my fellow regards at WSB.

1740164147.0,1iuykwm,"the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)","A few days ago, I saw the[ \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.

Today I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.

**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**

Why does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?

The answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.

[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.

Don’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.

Let me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.

**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**

Alright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.

First, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.

You see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.

If there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.

As if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. 

If you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. 

What does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”

I recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”

By way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.

Here is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:

>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Trump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.

Furthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\*\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\*\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.

**Part III: Positions**

Where to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.

https://preview.redd.it/gtl426m18rke1.jpg?width=639&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b46ae72c3552c0d547b0e3c58f81aa77087fdc82

Why did I pick these? (don't mind Humana, Uber, VST)

>**MP materials** is presently the only rare earth mine and processor in the United States.

>**LYS** is AU but part of ""The Quad"" that Trump opens the door for investments towards when he writes ""(k) The Secretary of State shall consider opportunities to advance the mining and processing of minerals within the United States through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue.""

>**REEMF** is self-explanatory, rare earth exploration

>**CAT**  is at a 6 month low. I thought that this was a good time to get in given ramping of mining in future. They have ties to Ukraine's post-war rebuilding via the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC).

>**TSLA** (not pictured; getting calls Monday) as Elon Musk is close with Trump and shares concern over lithium in particular. TSLA has [just launched operations in a lithium processing plant in TX as well](https://cen.acs.org/energy/energy-storage-/Tesla-begins-making-lithium-chemicals/102/web/2024/12#:~:text=Credit:%20Tesla,lithium%20production%20in%20the%20US) and I would not be surprised to see substantial federal funding in the short term and medium term. See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)

>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out. I'm bullish on it because of this language: ""(c)  The Secretary of the Interior shall instruct the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey to consider updating the Survey’s list of critical minerals, including for the potential of including uranium.""

>**IPX** up-and-coming titanium processing w/ a special patent.

>**TLOFF** is nickel, partnered with TSLA

>**ABAT** is US lithium batteries supply/recycling

>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.

I'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:

>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so""

Okay okay, I have just got a -98% decrease in my XP puts, but hey I just asked my wife's boyfriend for a little bit more money and some Wendy's payout. Let's start how this NVIDIA will fall.

Current situation:

* Jensen's kingdom got kicked out of 140 club, and back to 139 (at the time I write this shit DD), P/E 55.14 (compared to 55.96 for Industrial average) and will have another earning call next week. 
* President Trump are planning to tax 25% tariff on chips outside of US, a bubble for Nvidia manufacturing
* Yes yes I know 5000 series releases got sold out in seconds, but it was released on Jan 30, so it's next quarter so it doesn't do shit this quarter yet.

Why you should buy put?

* Insider trading shows that there is a massive sell off, obviously it doesn't say anything much.

[Insider Trading](https://preview.redd.it/t4w62gqc2jke1.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad922a3c0eb97ce48039d912bb1cc677eeff5db9)

* Nvidia tends to sensitive to news, especially world new and fluctuated the most when it comes to news.
* Nvidia main manufacturing is TSMC, which got unlove for our beloved President Trump (https://www.mk.co.kr/en/business/11243062)
* China (in general) wants to compete with chip manufacturing especially with Taiwan (https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2025/02/11/2003831653)
* Recently, Google and Microsoft starts to develop their own chips for their AI, so we are heading to era of independent chip-dependent from Nvidia
* Sure sure, ""yOu sTill nEEd to bUy nVidIa Chips"".From previous earnings, there is a 17% increase in Data Center revenue Q4 2024, a 16% increase in Data Center revenue Q3 2024, and 23% increase in Data Center revenue Q2 2024, and 27% increase in Q1 2024. There is a slow down increase and with a nearest quantum chips release from IQVN, Google, Microsoft, I anticipate that this quarter can still have an increase but not impressive
* So why I think Nvidia chips are stagnant? The investment of research from their previous earnings clearly shows that they don't want to heavily invest in research as much as before --> Chips independent era gonna be coming.

Why you should buy calls?

* Because I buy puts

1740161331.0,1iuxffd,Rivian (RIVN) Earnings Review - Bullish,"TLDR: Rivian is a BUY, because it’s cheap  

Post earnings call, Rivian has found gross profit, reducing vehicle production costs by $30k.  

Eyeing the R2 release in a year, they’ve sourced 95% of materials for it at half the cost of R1, seeing growing bargaining power in negotiations while realizing opportunities for production efficiencies.

People are pumped about the R2 release.  

With $7B of cash they are guiding towards a <($2B) loss for 2025 -  

leaving $5B of cash + $3.4B more from VW deal, putting them at a future $8.4B in cash alone for capex and expansion.  

While the DOE loan might see pressure, they will also create **7500 US MANUFACTURING JOBS in Georgia**.  

Killing manufacturing jobs isn’t really aligned with the current admin goals, even as they talk about ICE vehicles and the need to drill more.  

Guidance for ‘25 was conservatively flat given the environment, however -  

With Tesla protests happening and a deep fleet of existing owners, the Tesla to Rivian trade-up is happening in force, which will especially add to R2 demand and existing R1 demand.  

Between R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‘26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  

All of which doesn’t include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.

Rivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  

Rivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  

PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  

In the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  

Love the trade and upside here!

That loan is much needed by RIVN. 

They lose roughly $39,000 per vehicle sold currently, have $5.74B in debt and $7.70B in cash. TTM net income is -$4.75B. 

Once Trump took office, he vowed to “look into” the Rivian loan. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fate-rivian-6-6-billion-174558360.html?guccounter=1

Since Elon Musk is making most of these decisions, and he has shown to clearly bias his own businesses thus far with Tesla and SpaceX, it’s likely that they find a way to cancel this loan. 

If the loan gets cancelled, RIVN will sell off.

The only “positive” they could point to was a super weird assertion that they are “basically Netflix pre-streaming, when the business was mailing DVD’s” this was said maybe 6 times. 

Directly calling themselves out that they’re in an unsustainable path that’s requires a sidekick shift in the value they bring their users. They think that their AI search tool Dash is the key to future of the company, but then went on to say it will not have any impact towards revenue. It’s a totally delusional stance to have thinking you can turn your declining cloud storage customer base into some hyper growth AI search company. It’s a very crowded space that they aren’t even known for. 

TAM of $8Bil was quoted. Yet before that call they were a $10bil market cap. Yeah ok",24,14,https://i.redd.it/fijskmekkhke1.jpeg

1740109349.0,1iuhlv3,"BKSY BlackSky, the Most Interesting Space Stock You Haven't Heard Of","BlackSky owns a constellation of satellites that produce near real-time high-resolution imagery. Yesterday they successfully put the first of Gen-3 satellites into orbit with the help of Rocket Lab.

[https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-60th-electron-first-of-multiple-missions-for-blacksky/](https://www.rocketlabusa.com/updates/rocket-lab-successfully-launches-60th-electron-first-of-multiple-missions-for-blacksky/)

The Gen-3 boasts an impressive step up vs Gen-2. Including:

\- 30 min delivery  
\- 35 cm resolution  
\- performant in low light

What impresses me about the company is that have an absolutely ridiculous cadence of contracts announcements. We are talking new contracts week after week after week.

https://preview.redd.it/srlxn6g8weke1.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=396635b4408c866ab77a3571771e993c9db90b14

This has resulted produced a smooth as butter compounding machine that has recently inflected to positive ebidtda.

As far as valuation goes, it stacks of pretty damn nice. For example, far better grow and lower ev / sales multiple compared to it's closest peer PL.

Back in the day they had a strategic partnership with PLTR. Not notably sure if it is still ongoing: 

[https://www.blacksky.com/blacksky-secures-investment-from-palantir-and-enters-into-multi-year-strategic-partnership-following-successful-pilot-project/](https://www.blacksky.com/blacksky-secures-investment-from-palantir-and-enters-into-multi-year-strategic-partnership-following-successful-pilot-project/)

  
In sum, I think BKSY occupies a really interesting niche (high res, low latency imagery) that will likely be able to command really nice margins over time. And they have the benefit of a good liquidity and positive growth, so probably don't need to worry about being hammered by financing - as is the typical case with satellite companies - all that much.

I am rolling with a good slug of commons, and some calls for extra juice.
