1iuykwm,1740164147.0,"the sector you've never touched IS a 10-bagger, but not like that [DD w/ $250k invested)","A few days ago, I saw the[ \[DD\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ir0k5o/this_sector_youve_never_touched_is_a_10bagger_dd/) posted here about the mining industry. The OP of this post was right to point out that the mining sector is due for a massive run and I appreciated the attention they drew to the qualities of a high return opportunity.  However, their recommendation was mostly to invest in mining related to GOLD! Reading that was like watching one set the dining table beautifully, only to proceed to mistake the appetizer for the main dish.

Today I’m going to provide further evidence for the case that the mining industry presents a massive opportunity on a timescale anywhere from right now to the end of Trump’s term. The investments that are going to make you rich, however, have nothing to do with gold, per se, and everything to do with titanium, lithium, rare earth minerals, and the complete market dominance China has over their processing and extraction.

**Part I: Ukraine, Greenland, Russia, and the Allied Supply Chain**

Why does Trump care so much about Greenland? Why is he so insistent on Ukraine signing away 50% of their claim to Ukraine’s minerals and, if that matters so much, why did he cut Ukraine out from the opening negotiations with Russia?

The answer is that it's all about the supply chain of minerals and metals. China is bending us over the table with their grip over the chain (80-90%+ dominance), especially in separation/processing of the materials. Recently, they [have gone as far as to ban key processing/separation materials needed](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinese-lithium-company-halts-tech-exports-trade-tensions-build-2025-02-18/), posturing to protect their interests in the face of American policy strides to distance themselves from their grip over the market. They have also kept costs of lithium and other precious earth and minerals artificially low, stymieing western incentive to establish their own supply chain.

[China has been *SO* effective at doing all of this,](https://www.wsj.com/finance/commodities-futures/china-dominant-mineral-mining-global-supply-chain-e2b7840e) that until the last few years, there was **ZERO** mining/processing of rare earth happening domestically in the USA. The picture wasn’t much better for other crucial metals and resources, such as lithium and titanium. We slept too long, took them for granted, and now here we are.

Don’t understand the stakes? [Here is **Marco Rubio**](https://uscriticalmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Marco-Rubio-video.mp4), our secretary of state who has recently opened up  negotiations with Russia over Ukraine, being an absolute doomer about the supply chain. Here is an article he wrote r[ecently on the matter too](https://thehill.com/opinion/4817683-critical-minerals-crisis-china/).  **Lindsey Graham -** another key Trump ally - also has eyes on the issue, especially as it pertains to Ukraine and what they may offer us for security (check out these tweets [here ](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1891046931323040187)and [here](https://x.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1799832487285465244)). Oh and remember that scandal with Boeing having compromised metals in their planes? Yep, that's also because of the supply chain [being decoupled from the west](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/40637-how-boeings-counterfeit-titanium-crisis-was-predictable-and-preventable&ved=2ahUKEwj2iYS3y9eLAxVZwvACHU6RKzAQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1vrXeJfqlxo_MfhMITKxyD) and this issue is only going to become a bigger thorn in the side of western interests as time goes on and demand continues to grow.

Let me be clear that this is a bipartisan issue and it is *extremely* difficult to deny the threat this poses to our national security and economic prosperity (the previous administration came to the same conclusion). That is why it has been a priority of both administrations. However, this present iteration of the Trump administration is uniquely situated to set the market ablaze in ways that previous administrations could not.

**Part II. Trump Administration, Republican Majorities, Cosmetics, and Converging Interests**

Alright, so we've established that the US is seriously threatened by China’s stranglehold over this sector. Great. So what is this administration and other key players in the industry doing about it? Here are a few points that I find compelling in making the case for the mining industry about to have a massive run.

First, let me introduce you to **Ronald S. Lauder**, heir to the Estée Lauder cosmetics company. For whatever reason, this guy has a real penchant for minerals and mining. He is [*close friends* with Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/12/world/europe/trump-ukraine-rare-earth-minerals.html) and is, according to the NY times, the one that initially led Trump to turn his attention to Greenland. He is also very interested in Ukrainian minerals and metals.

You see, Ronald Lauder is a business partner of **Brian Menell**, CEO of private investment/equity firm [**TechMet**](https://www.techmet.com/), which seeks to expand production of precious minerals across our global assets to help ensure a secure and sustainable supply of the key metals for western-aligned interests.

If there is one company to look at and one company alone, it is TechMet. Recently, they have secured 180 million from **QIA (Saudi fund)**. They are also **DOE and DFC** contractors with extremely lucrative deals over the last few years. Furthermore, what makes them unusual is that the DFC decided against their usual financing terms and actually went ahead and bought a direct stake in TechMet itself. That means the **US Federal Government** is a stakeholder directly aligned with the interests and priorities of TechMet.

As if this was not enough, TechMet also has the investment/backing of energy behemoth Mercuria. They also hold advisory members and business partners from big name mining companies like Rio Tinto. Furthermore, their current chairman is **Admiral Mike Mullen** who was previously Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as on the board of **General Motors.** Suffice to say that their present reach and influence over western government is compelling as anything I have ever seen before. 

If you are curious, here is Brian Menell, two or so weeks ago, discussing the present state of the administration and supply chain issues [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP9_PY5gEug&ab_channel=SmarterMarkets%E2%84%A2) He is bullish about this administration and highlights what needs to happen in order to compete with China effectively. 

What does he stress? **Permitting, Bureaucracy Reform, Federal Incentivization.** He calls on the administration to lift regulations, give permits quickly, purchase directly and invest in western-aligned companies that are working on the energy transition. Trump is doing *exactly* this, from establishing the sovereign wealth fund, to the guidance issued by way of two executive actions “[Unleashing American Energy”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/), as well as  [“Unleashing Prosperity through Deregulation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation/).”

I recommend you read the language, especially Section 9 of the executive order on energy. The order seeks to “establish our position as the leading producer and processor of non-fuel minerals, including rare earth minerals, which will create jobs and prosperity at home, strengthen supply chains for the United States and its allies, and reduce the global influence of malign and adversarial states” as well as “to protect the United States' economic and national security and military preparedness by ensuring that an abundant supply of reliable energy is readily accessible in every State and territory of the Nation”

By way of the executive orders, federal agencies are instructed (within 60 days) to identify and eliminate barriers to efficient private investment and reduce project timelines for critical energy. Trump also instructs that priority should be placed on making sure USA funds critical mineral ventures and he also instructs to make sure the USA has an adequate stockpile of critical minerals/metals (and to purchase more if not). Emphasis is also placed on geologic mapping, and key western partnerships that share national  security interests, called the **“Quad.”** If you are interested in further reading on this last point, I recommend[ this article ](https://www.orfonline.org/research/the-case-for-a-quad-mineral-security-partnership#_edn81)on Quadrilateral Mineral Partnerships.

Here is another item in the order on Unleashing American Energy:

>(j) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, the United States Trade Representative, and the heads of any other relevant agencies, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy that includes policy recommendations to enhance the competitiveness of American mining and refining companies in other mineral-wealthy nations.

Trump is not a patient man. He will act quickly after receiving this report in March and he is already trying his best to wrap up Ukraine as quickly as possible too with assurances of mineral access. That's why I believe the shortest timeline to return is now to the end of Trump's term.

Furthermore, I believe that Trump's team began negotiations without Ukraine precisely because they are seeking to get the best minerals deal possible. Russian advances on Ukraine have meant that many of the precious minerals the west is interested in now falls within Russian-occupied territory in Ukraine. Having 50% of the rights to Ukraine's rare earth is not all that great, given this reality\*\*. There is no guarantee that Ukraine will win the war (or when), nor is there a guarantee they will ever regain the territory.\*\* Meanwhile, the US would presumably continue to pump money into Ukraine with no end in sight? Trump isn't going to be OK with that. I think he is working out a post-war deal with Russia that makes certain that minerals will be available immediately.

**Part III: Positions**

Where to invest? Well, Techmet is private. However, there are still plays that can be made in this sector. Right now I have \~$250,000 in derivatives and stock opened yesterday and today. Here is where I am at the moment, though I will absolutely re-balance as I continue to do research.

See [also this article.](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/where-does-tesla-get-its-lithium)

>**UUUU** is largely uranium although they are branching out.

>**Other Ideas:** I would welcome other suggestions regarding investments that get the right kind of exposure. There are two or three more investments I intend to make on Monday, which I'll disclose when I decide what they will be. I may also adjust a few things here and there.

I'll close with this. Brian Menell, after meeting Mr. Zelensky in NY alongside other energy executives in September, had this to say in a statement:

>“TechMet, together with our partners, is available to move forward with further work if the U.S. and Ukrainian governments instruct us to do so""

Between R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‘26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  

All of which doesn’t include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.

Rivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.

Between R2 revenue at minimum $4.5B in ‘26, R1 sales, VW JV bringing in $2B in revenue (or more, as VW CEO has hinted at), potential further demand from other makers for Rivian tech,  

All of which doesn’t include EDV sales which just opened in February to other fleets, while they guide lower due to Amazon taking on slightly more orders in '24 and slightly less in '25, this is a unique differentiator that furthers the upside.

Rivian not only has a strong path to profitability, but likely future SPY inclusion as it reaches scale and profitability.  

Rivian is well capitalized, backed by big players who believe in their position, and most importantly -  

PEOPLE LOVE THEIR PRODUCT.  

In the last year, Rivian is down 15%, while the company position and story becomes better and better.  

Love the trade and upside here!

Palantir has been on a tear recently, all hyped up on the defense sector growth but no one is really paying attention to Meta Defense and their entry to the space. Last year Meta opened up its AI models to defense agencies and contractors. This is huge for them to get this level of clearance and i think this will will put them in direct competition with Palantir. Im not sure how they build out this branch of Meta, Im calling it Meta Defense but they fired all their woke people and are starting to re-shape the company.

Yes, there is defense spending cuts but its all on waste and overcharged contracts not on things that actually matter for the dept of defense. During the inauguration Zuckerberg was in the front row, Hegseth was somewhere in the back. Just an observation.

Everyone is familiar with their social media business so there isnt a whole lot to talk about there. AI keeps improving, More growth from Reels, Threads, Facebook. Their LLM is impressive and arguably one of the best, putting them up there with OpenAI.

With all there user data they have Meta Analytics could be another source of revenue.

They are sitting on a goldmine with Facebook market place. i get they have ads but i feel they could do more.  Im not sure Zuckerberg realized what he has there but this business if monetized right could be HUGE.

1itncot,1740017137.0,"Palantir plunges after CEO Karp changes share sales plan, Pentagon budget cut report","The share price of Palantir fell as much as 12.5% Wednesday after news that CEO Alex Karp had adopted a new stock trading plan, and a report that the Pentagon has been ordered to prepare to cut the U.S. defense budget by 8% each year for the next five years.

Palantir is best known for its contracting work providing software and technology services for defense agencies.

On Tuesday night, Palantir in a regulatory filing disclosed that Karp’s new plan will allow him to sell nearly 10 million shares of company stock in the next six months.

The Washington Post on Wednesday said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered senior Pentagon leaders and other military brass to develop plans to slash the defense budget over the next half decade. The budget for the current fiscal year is around $850 billion.

The Post reported that Hegseth ordered the proposed cuts to be drawn up by Monday.

Palantir closed trading Wednesday at $112.06 per share, a drop of 10%. Shares were down more than 1.5% in after-hours trading.

The company, whose market capitalization tops $255 billion, in early February reported $828 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, with adjusted earnings of 14 cents per share.

Before Wednesday’s abrupt drop, Palantir had been one of the top-performing stocks in the U.S. for the last two years, including a share price rise of nearly 50% in the year to date.

Palantir trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 600-to-1.

The Trump administration has been engaged in a wide-ranging effort to slash government spending and the number of federal government workers since President Donald Trump was inaugurated for a second nonconsecutive term on Jan. 20.

Trump appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk to oversee that effort, dubbed the “Department of Government Efficiency.”

Musk and Trump have come under fire for their methods in achieving DOGE’s goal, with some steps being challenged successfully in federal court.

On Tuesday, Karp, who co-founded the company with Peter Thiel, defended Musk during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”

“What the progressive left should be doing is saying, ‘OK, Elon, you’re clearly the most qualified person in the world to do something like this. We want a dialog with you about what you’re doing, how you’re doing,’” Karp said.

“I don’t believe that’s happened,” he added.

1ishu2q,1739898888.0,$PARA YOLO - Undervalued Giant with Massive Upside Potential,"**Paramount Global ($PARA) is an undervalued giant hiding in plain sight.** The misunderstood fundamentals and exaggerated expectation for the death of traditional media has fueled a shockingly unique opportunity on a company that is fundamentally sound and poised for future growth due to its incredibly strong brands. Despite its negative reputation due to the Shari Redstone mismanagement of M&A and the difficulty that traditional media companies have been facing, $PARA is a massively undervalued media powerhouse with legendary brands in CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Pictures, etc. This company is a media giant trading at fire sale prices. With a laughably low P/S ratio (\~0.24) and EV/EBITDA (\~5x), PARA is far cheaper than its competitors despite looking poised for a recovery, especially with the looming Skydance merger.

 

**Fundamentals:**

The fundamentals are honestly simple to me. Paramount has been struggling over the last few years to escape the difficulties that traditional media companies have been facing. They have been ineffective at creating enough revenue and operational efficiency/ focus to make any meaningful impact in their debt since about 2018 when their debt initially exploded upwards. Because of these factors, Wall Street and Retail have both soured on Paramount.

Paramount+ has been relatively successful, but the investment has not justified the returns thus far, however this aspect of their business has been steadily improving. In their last quarterly report, Paramount+ added 3.5M new subscribers, showing that the platform is still bringing in new customers. Beyond this, Paramount has exceptionally strong brands that are not going to die, no matter what comes of the future of media.

To further embolden the case for the intrinsic value hidden within Paramount, here are some of Paramount's Notable Brands: All of CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, and quite a few more, with all associated brand IP (think SpongeBob, South Park, Avatar, The Daily Show, etc.). Point being, **these are brands that people interact with CONSTANTLY. Hours and hours of attention is spent on these brands each day.** And despite network cable’s viewership “decreasing”, CBS is still the #1 channel and rakes in about 4.8ish million viewers per day. Attention is the most valuable commodity in our world. Monetization of the traditional media platforms has been challenging, but with new leadership and the huge investment being made, **I am betting that they see incredible opportunity for growth with this company.**

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that there are quite a few things that have been stacked against this stock for a long time, most notably the situation with 70% of controlling shares being held by Shari Redstone, who managed the company abysmally and ruined a potentially lucrative buyout for shareholders, making further M&A negotiations chaotic and unpredictable. However, she agreed to sell her control of the company in July of 2024 to Skydance, who will now be controlling the company with their current CEO, David Ellison (the son of Larry Ellison). **Shari being gone and competent leadership coming into the scene is a huge, huge deal. This merger has created a very unique situation for $PARA, which I believe to be a win-win for investors.**

 

Honestly, though, all of this is drivel. **What matters to me with the Paramount fundamentals is this**:

*Paramount's Market Cap:* $8B flat

*Paramount's TTM Revenue:* $28.9B

*Price to Book Ratio:* .43

*Price to Sales Ratio:* .24 (compare this to Netflix's PS ratio of 11.76, or even $WBD's of .64)

*EV / EBITDA:* \~5x (compare with Netflix of 17x, Disney \~10x)

The debt situation I have seen so much negative sentiment about online appears to be utterly overblown and I honestly don't see how people think this company is financially dying. Let me sum it up as follows:

*Debt to equity:* .94 (fine)

*Debt to assets:* .34 (good)

*Quick ratio:* 1.10

*Net margin:* \-.06 (trending better, hope this flips positive again soon, but I don't see reason for concern)

QoQ Total and Net Debt has been trending DOWN since Q2 2020

Free cash flow has been stably positive since Q3 of 2023, currently at $762M TTM

*Cash on hand:* $2.44B

Skydance merger will immediately inject $1.5B in capital once closed

There are deep value stocks, then there are…….. you know the rest.

 

 

**Technicals:**

Getting into the chart it seems evident to me that price has been pushed down about as far as it can be without something fundamentally changing. I like to buy my stocks at lows and sell them at highs (don’t you?). As you look through my TA, think about whether this price seems like a low or a high to you.

There are 3 timeframes that I will focus on; the monthly, weekly, and daily.

Please note that **current price is $11.30** at the time of writing this post

 

*Monthly*

https://preview.redd.it/yb9zabv1jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f05db27a086c13828f255c0689bd27baeeef07

Macro Point of Control: $10.66 (price is above)

Macro Fibonacci Golden Pocket: $10.44-$11.68 (price is within and has held as strong support)

RSI: Bounced off bear zone and has been steadily (though slowly) rising since Feb 2024

MACD: Bullish divergence printed Oct 2023, has been steadily green and rising since Feb 2024, signal cross up in Jan 2024

Lastly, volume has been seeing some pretty significant influxes throughout this downtrend it’s been in since 2021 and volume has been consistently higher during this 4-year trend than it’s been at really any point since the 2008/2009 market shenanigans. This may indicate accumulation, especially so since 2024.

 

*Weekly*

  

https://preview.redd.it/r8rhzvd4jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=475549c3ca26b39b7f689e96e32796ae2050af68

The consolidation in the golden pocket is really beautiful. The fact that you had a significant bounce from the .65 to the .5 *exactly* confirms the validity of using fibs on this chart and solidifies this golden pocket range as very strong support.

The weekly Bollinger Bands have squeezed to their 3rd tightest width in the history of this stock, and the narrowest they've been since January of 2018. Generally speaking, tight BBs lead to explosive price breakouts.

MACD and RSI have been printing bullish divergence for 3 years without much, if any, positive price action following. In my opinion this *will* change. Reversal in trend *is* imminent. There is a looming catalyst for this to reverse when the company reports earnings on Feb 26.

 

https://preview.redd.it/0tv16j253yje1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef26c06db90cd9260b5f2553edfc3083c08b635

The Weekly ADX is actually beautiful. This is one of the lowest ADX values I've ever seen on a weekly chart for a company as big as $PARA, and it's starting to curl up. Simultaneously DMI+ is going up while DMI- is going down. This looks similar to the ADX setups $TSLA had in October of 2012 before a 535% run, $UPST had in June of 2024 before a 350% run (this one looks the most structurally similar to $PARA in many ways), $COST had in June of 2024 before a 100%+ run, $BABA in Apr 2024 before an 82% run, $INTC in June of 2017 before an 73% run, and $DIS before a 56% run. What I can't find is similar ADX setups that didn't have significant breakouts up or down.

 

https://preview.redd.it/ppnb1c0fjxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a4a872f8458bf897d8c5ca09e9899dd67dbf57

And how about a Triple Bottom on the weekly RSI just to further solidify my position of being on the precipice of a bullish breakout. It's not perfect, but chart patterns rarely are, and its close enough to be very intriguing.

 

*Daily*

https://preview.redd.it/w0b9k1h63yje1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac18eef8caa65fbfc7c372e9b433b0d49cfa6a11

There are two chart patterns that are completing/ have completed. One is a falling wedge; the other is a pennant. The falling wedge has a price target of approximately $25. The pennant has a price target of approximately $5.26. Do you think it’s more likely that this company halves in value again, down to a $4b market cap, or *returns to a more reasonable valuation* of \~ $20b market cap?

There are also numerous gaps to the upside on the chart that I expect to be filled once a bullish trend reappears. Gaps are from \~$19-$23, \~$34.50-$36, and \~$85-$91.25.

https://preview.redd.it/xgawv1y73yje1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bb02f718152b2fa47168a6ba1c20bef64b68b7

 The last thing that I want to highlight for is that the 50 and 200 daily moving averages are currently in a $0.20 range. There **will** be a golden cross very, very soon if price holds above $11. Algorithmic traders will rush in when this happens.

 

To summarize how bullish the technicals are:

1. Consolidating in a macro golden pocket above the point of control
2. Bullish divergence on the monthly MACD
3. 9 touches of bullish divergence on the weekly RSI & MACD
4. Weekly ADX is completely cracked out and looks poised for a **massive** run
5. Weekly RSI has a triple bottom with a very bullish outlook
6. Falling wedge pattern and gaps on the chart point towards a run deep into the $20 range
7. Daily golden cross is imminent if price holds above $11

 

**Some fun stuff:**

Short interest is 11% and the Days to Cover is \~13. While this isn't a huge amount in comparison to some previous meme stonks, this is quite significant for a stock the size of $PARA, and the size of this position is exemplified by the days to cover. When I compared this to Paramount’s competitors, I found that it is 3x-10x the short position of any other company in the sector. Additionally, I pulled the options flow data for the last 9 months to analyze the outstanding bearish premium. What I've found is what I believe to be a ticking time bomb. There is approximately $39M in net bearish put premium that is not closed, and $4M in net bearish call premium. This means that (in my opinion based on my analysis) there is approximately **$43M (22.46M shares worth of contract, or approximately 45% of free float) in net bearish premium yet to be closed**, that, if correct, will dump gasoline on the fire of a run if $PARA begins to break out and these positions are forced to close. These are trades that I believe to be held predominantly by Hedge Funds and institutions, and I believe that they are overexposed on this trade due to the belief that $15 is a price cap until merger. If price reverses and goes beyond the $15 buyout price, a mass unwinding of these positions (both the short positions AND the bearish contracts) will have to take place as the perceived price ""ceiling"" could be shattered.

 

*Final point:* \*securing tin foil hat and preparing for berating\* I believe that the options data I analyzed has uncovered a significant arbitrage play that is in the works. This Skydance-Paramount merger arbitrage trade is a ticking time bomb. Someone has been shorting PARA near $15 and hedging with bearish put options, betting that the deal price caps upside. But if PARA breaks and holds above $15, these trades fall apart, causing the holder to potentially cover their position, put holders to unwind, and institutions to scramble to reposition. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure, breaking the artificial price ceiling and leading to a massive price surge. If the deal is renegotiated or collapses as a result of this price action, PARA could explode MUCH higher.

 

**Tldr;**

Paramount Global ($PARA) is an absurdly undervalued media giant that Wall Street has pushed down as far as it can, setting up what I believe to be a uniquely explosive opportunity. Despite owning powerhouse brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, $PARA trades at a laughably low valuation—its P/S ratio is just 0.24, its EV/EBITDA is \~5x, and it’s generating $28.9B in revenue on an $8B market cap. Meanwhile, short interest sits around 10% (\~12+ days to cover), and I’ve identified $43M in outstanding net bearish premium (45% of free float exposed) still open, which I believe will act as gasoline on the fire if price begins to break out. Adding to the intrigue, the Skydance merger deal has created a forced price ceiling at $15, which institutions have been using to execute merger arbitrage trades—if that ceiling is broken, it could cause mass unwinding of short positions and a re-rating of the stock. Technicals are screaming reversal, with bullish divergence on multiple timeframes, the ADX setup mirroring historic breakout runs ($TSLA, $UPST, $DIS), and an imminent Golden Cross about to happen on the daily chart. If retail sentiment shifts and $PARA starts moving, this could be a perfect storm of undervaluation, squeeze potential, and institutional mispositioning, leading to a rapid and violent price correction to the upside. Everyone is sleeping on $PARA. It's time to wake up.

I've had success with these big bets of mine in the past year, but past performance does not always indicate future success. Do not invest in something that you have not personally researched, and do not invest unless you have identified clear entry, stop losses, and exit points that work for YOU.This is not financial advice; I am merely sharing my personal excitement about a trade I am making.*

1ishu2q,1739898888.0,$PARA YOLO - Undervalued Giant with Massive Upside Potential,"**Paramount Global ($PARA) is an undervalued giant hiding in plain sight.** The misunderstood fundamentals and exaggerated expectation for the death of traditional media has fueled a shockingly unique opportunity on a company that is fundamentally sound and poised for future growth due to its incredibly strong brands. Despite its negative reputation due to the Shari Redstone mismanagement of M&A and the difficulty that traditional media companies have been facing, $PARA is a massively undervalued media powerhouse with legendary brands in CBS, Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, MTV, Paramount Pictures, etc. This company is a media giant trading at fire sale prices. With a laughably low P/S ratio (\~0.24) and EV/EBITDA (\~5x), PARA is far cheaper than its competitors despite looking poised for a recovery, especially with the looming Skydance merger.

 

**Fundamentals:**

The fundamentals are honestly simple to me. Paramount has been struggling over the last few years to escape the difficulties that traditional media companies have been facing. They have been ineffective at creating enough revenue and operational efficiency/ focus to make any meaningful impact in their debt since about 2018 when their debt initially exploded upwards. Because of these factors, Wall Street and Retail have both soured on Paramount.

Paramount+ has been relatively successful, but the investment has not justified the returns thus far, however this aspect of their business has been steadily improving. In their last quarterly report, Paramount+ added 3.5M new subscribers, showing that the platform is still bringing in new customers. Beyond this, Paramount has exceptionally strong brands that are not going to die, no matter what comes of the future of media.

To further embolden the case for the intrinsic value hidden within Paramount, here are some of Paramount's Notable Brands: All of CBS, BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Showtime, and quite a few more, with all associated brand IP (think SpongeBob, South Park, Avatar, The Daily Show, etc.). Point being, **these are brands that people interact with CONSTANTLY. Hours and hours of attention is spent on these brands each day.** And despite network cable’s viewership “decreasing”, CBS is still the #1 channel and rakes in about 4.8ish million viewers per day. Attention is the most valuable commodity in our world. Monetization of the traditional media platforms has been challenging, but with new leadership and the huge investment being made, **I am betting that they see incredible opportunity for growth with this company.**

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that there are quite a few things that have been stacked against this stock for a long time, most notably the situation with 70% of controlling shares being held by Shari Redstone, who managed the company abysmally and ruined a potentially lucrative buyout for shareholders, making further M&A negotiations chaotic and unpredictable. However, she agreed to sell her control of the company in July of 2024 to Skydance, who will now be controlling the company with their current CEO, David Ellison (the son of Larry Ellison). **Shari being gone and competent leadership coming into the scene is a huge, huge deal. This merger has created a very unique situation for $PARA, which I believe to be a win-win for investors.**

 

Honestly, though, all of this is drivel. **What matters to me with the Paramount fundamentals is this**:

*Paramount's Market Cap:* $8B flat

*Paramount's TTM Revenue:* $28.9B

*Price to Book Ratio:* .43

*Price to Sales Ratio:* .24 (compare this to Netflix's PS ratio of 11.76, or even $WBD's of .64)

*EV / EBITDA:* \~5x (compare with Netflix of 17x, Disney \~10x)

The debt situation I have seen so much negative sentiment about online appears to be utterly overblown and I honestly don't see how people think this company is financially dying. Let me sum it up as follows:

*Debt to equity:* .94 (fine)

*Debt to assets:* .34 (good)

*Quick ratio:* 1.10

*Net margin:* \-.06 (trending better, hope this flips positive again soon, but I don't see reason for concern)

QoQ Total and Net Debt has been trending DOWN since Q2 2020

Free cash flow has been stably positive since Q3 of 2023, currently at $762M TTM

*Cash on hand:* $2.44B

Skydance merger will immediately inject $1.5B in capital once closed

There are deep value stocks, then there are…….. you know the rest.

 

 

**Technicals:**

Getting into the chart it seems evident to me that price has been pushed down about as far as it can be without something fundamentally changing. I like to buy my stocks at lows and sell them at highs (don’t you?). As you look through my TA, think about whether this price seems like a low or a high to you.

There are 3 timeframes that I will focus on; the monthly, weekly, and daily.

Please note that **current price is $11.30** at the time of writing this post

 

*Monthly*

https://preview.redd.it/yb9zabv1jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=26f05db27a086c13828f255c0689bd27baeeef07

Macro Point of Control: $10.66 (price is above)

Macro Fibonacci Golden Pocket: $10.44-$11.68 (price is within and has held as strong support)

RSI: Bounced off bear zone and has been steadily (though slowly) rising since Feb 2024

MACD: Bullish divergence printed Oct 2023, has been steadily green and rising since Feb 2024, signal cross up in Jan 2024

Lastly, volume has been seeing some pretty significant influxes throughout this downtrend it’s been in since 2021 and volume has been consistently higher during this 4-year trend than it’s been at really any point since the 2008/2009 market shenanigans. This may indicate accumulation, especially so since 2024.

 

*Weekly*

  

https://preview.redd.it/r8rhzvd4jxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=475549c3ca26b39b7f689e96e32796ae2050af68

The consolidation in the golden pocket is really beautiful. The fact that you had a significant bounce from the .65 to the .5 *exactly* confirms the validity of using fibs on this chart and solidifies this golden pocket range as very strong support.

The weekly Bollinger Bands have squeezed to their 3rd tightest width in the history of this stock, and the narrowest they've been since January of 2018. Generally speaking, tight BBs lead to explosive price breakouts.

MACD and RSI have been printing bullish divergence for 3 years without much, if any, positive price action following. In my opinion this *will* change. Reversal in trend *is* imminent. There is a looming catalyst for this to reverse when the company reports earnings on Feb 26.

 

https://preview.redd.it/0tv16j253yje1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ef26c06db90cd9260b5f2553edfc3083c08b635

The Weekly ADX is actually beautiful. This is one of the lowest ADX values I've ever seen on a weekly chart for a company as big as $PARA, and it's starting to curl up. Simultaneously DMI+ is going up while DMI- is going down. This looks similar to the ADX setups $TSLA had in October of 2012 before a 535% run, $UPST had in June of 2024 before a 350% run (this one looks the most structurally similar to $PARA in many ways), $COST had in June of 2024 before a 100%+ run, $BABA in Apr 2024 before an 82% run, $INTC in June of 2017 before an 73% run, and $DIS before a 56% run. What I can't find is similar ADX setups that didn't have significant breakouts up or down.

 

https://preview.redd.it/ppnb1c0fjxje1.png?width=1430&format=png&auto=webp&s=96a4a872f8458bf897d8c5ca09e9899dd67dbf57

And how about a Triple Bottom on the weekly RSI just to further solidify my position of being on the precipice of a bullish breakout. It's not perfect, but chart patterns rarely are, and its close enough to be very intriguing.

 

*Daily*

https://preview.redd.it/w0b9k1h63yje1.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac18eef8caa65fbfc7c372e9b433b0d49cfa6a11

There are two chart patterns that are completing/ have completed. One is a falling wedge; the other is a pennant. The falling wedge has a price target of approximately $25. The pennant has a price target of approximately $5.26. Do you think it’s more likely that this company halves in value again, down to a $4b market cap, or *returns to a more reasonable valuation* of \~ $20b market cap?

There are also numerous gaps to the upside on the chart that I expect to be filled once a bullish trend reappears. Gaps are from \~$19-$23, \~$34.50-$36, and \~$85-$91.25.

https://preview.redd.it/xgawv1y73yje1.png?width=1316&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7bb02f718152b2fa47168a6ba1c20bef64b68b7

 The last thing that I want to highlight for is that the 50 and 200 daily moving averages are currently in a $0.20 range. There **will** be a golden cross very, very soon if price holds above $11. Algorithmic traders will rush in when this happens.

 

To summarize how bullish the technicals are:

1. Consolidating in a macro golden pocket above the point of control
2. Bullish divergence on the monthly MACD
3. 9 touches of bullish divergence on the weekly RSI & MACD
4. Weekly ADX is completely cracked out and looks poised for a **massive** run
5. Weekly RSI has a triple bottom with a very bullish outlook
6. Falling wedge pattern and gaps on the chart point towards a run deep into the $20 range
7. Daily golden cross is imminent if price holds above $11

 

**Some fun stuff:**

Short interest is 11% and the Days to Cover is \~13. While this isn't a huge amount in comparison to some previous meme stonks, this is quite significant for a stock the size of $PARA, and the size of this position is exemplified by the days to cover. When I compared this to Paramount’s competitors, I found that it is 3x-10x the short position of any other company in the sector. Additionally, I pulled the options flow data for the last 9 months to analyze the outstanding bearish premium. What I've found is what I believe to be a ticking time bomb. There is approximately $39M in net bearish put premium that is not closed, and $4M in net bearish call premium. This means that (in my opinion based on my analysis) there is approximately **$43M (22.46M shares worth of contract, or approximately 45% of free float) in net bearish premium yet to be closed**, that, if correct, will dump gasoline on the fire of a run if $PARA begins to break out and these positions are forced to close. These are trades that I believe to be held predominantly by Hedge Funds and institutions, and I believe that they are overexposed on this trade due to the belief that $15 is a price cap until merger. If price reverses and goes beyond the $15 buyout price, a mass unwinding of these positions (both the short positions AND the bearish contracts) will have to take place as the perceived price ""ceiling"" could be shattered.

 

*Final point:* \*securing tin foil hat and preparing for berating\* I believe that the options data I analyzed has uncovered a significant arbitrage play that is in the works. This Skydance-Paramount merger arbitrage trade is a ticking time bomb. Someone has been shorting PARA near $15 and hedging with bearish put options, betting that the deal price caps upside. But if PARA breaks and holds above $15, these trades fall apart, causing the holder to potentially cover their position, put holders to unwind, and institutions to scramble to reposition. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure, breaking the artificial price ceiling and leading to a massive price surge. If the deal is renegotiated or collapses as a result of this price action, PARA could explode MUCH higher.

 

**Tldr;**

Paramount Global ($PARA) is an absurdly undervalued media giant that Wall Street has pushed down as far as it can, setting up what I believe to be a uniquely explosive opportunity. Despite owning powerhouse brands like CBS, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, and Paramount Pictures, $PARA trades at a laughably low valuation—its P/S ratio is just 0.24, its EV/EBITDA is \~5x, and it’s generating $28.9B in revenue on an $8B market cap. Meanwhile, short interest sits around 10% (\~12+ days to cover), and I’ve identified $43M in outstanding net bearish premium (45% of free float exposed) still open, which I believe will act as gasoline on the fire if price begins to break out. Adding to the intrigue, the Skydance merger deal has created a forced price ceiling at $15, which institutions have been using to execute merger arbitrage trades—if that ceiling is broken, it could cause mass unwinding of short positions and a re-rating of the stock. Technicals are screaming reversal, with bullish divergence on multiple timeframes, the ADX setup mirroring historic breakout runs ($TSLA, $UPST, $DIS), and an imminent Golden Cross about to happen on the daily chart. If retail sentiment shifts and $PARA starts moving, this could be a perfect storm of undervaluation, squeeze potential, and institutional mispositioning, leading to a rapid and violent price correction to the upside. Everyone is sleeping on $PARA. It's time to wake up.

1irml3j,1739806580.0,BlackBerry: A Legacy Stock That’s Going To Get Re-Rated And Run,"BlackBerry is not a dead brand. It’s not a failed smartphone company. It’s not just another stock that spikes when retail traders pile in and then disappears.

It is a deeply entrenched, high-margin infrastructure software business that has gone completely unnoticed in the AI-driven rally. While every software stock remotely connected to AI, IoT, or automation trades at sky-high valuations, BlackBerry—which powers 255M+ vehicles and counting—still trades like a company with no future.

The reality is different. BlackBerry dominates real-time, safety-critical automotive systems with its QNX operating system, and it’s now layering on a SaaS-like business with IVY, a cloud-based vehicle data platform co-developed with AWS.

IVY allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize vehicle sensor data in real time. This is exactly the kind of AI-adjacent, cloud-powered software business that should be trading at 10x revenue, yet the market assigns it zero value.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX is embedded in 255M+ vehicles and continues to expand at 20M+ per year.
* IVY has secured early adopters, including Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng, and Mitsubishi Electric.
* The cybersecurity division, generating $350M–$365M annually, is now stabilized and profitable.

Every other infrastructure software business with this kind of positioning has already been re-rated higher—this one just hasn’t caught up yet.

# The Trade: BlackBerry Gets Re-Rated in the Next 2–3 Quarters—Possibly as Soon as Earnings April 2nd

QNX is growing, IVY is ramping up, and cybersecurity has stabilized, yet the stock price still reflects none of this.

* If BlackBerry provides strong IVY guidance next earnings, the re-rating could start immediately.
* Even without IVY, QNX’s backlog alone justifies a higher multiple.
* Cybersecurity, previously a drag on performance, is now quietly generating cash.

This setup provides a margin of safety with significant upside.

Even if IVY takes time to scale, QNX alone is worth more than what the market is assigning to BlackBerry today.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as an infrastructure software business, it trades at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters. That does not include IVY guidance or it's potential impact on price, which could drive the stock much higher.

# QNX: The Operating System Running Inside 255M+ Vehicles

QNX is not an infotainment OS—it’s the real-time, safety-critical software running inside automotive systems.

* Installed in 255M+ vehicles, growing by 20M+ per year
* $815M backlog (+27% YoY) ensures forward revenue visibility
* Trusted by nearly every major automaker, including BMW, Toyota, Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Honda, Stellantis, Bosch, Continental, Magna, and Denso

QNX is embedded in ADAS, digital instrument clusters, telematics, and secure gateways—systems where failure is not an option. Automakers don’t replace this kind of software lightly, which is why QNX enjoys high retention and a long revenue tail.

As vehicles become more software-driven, QNX’s role is only growing.

* Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs) require real-time OS solutions that QNX already dominates
* QNX Hypervisor enables multiple systems to run securely on a single chip, increasing its value per vehicle
* EVs and autonomous systems require low-latency, high-reliability computing—exactly what QNX provides

If QNX were valued like a strategic AI-driven infrastructure software provider, it would not be trading at 5x revenue.

A more appropriate 8–10x multiple puts QNX’s valuation at $2.5B–$3.5B alone.

Right now, the market is treating QNX like a legacy asset when it’s actually growing and gaining importance.

# IVY: The Unpriced SaaS Upside That Could Change the Entire Valuation

BlackBerry IVY is a co-developed vehicle data platform with AWS that allows automakers to process, analyze, and monetize in-car data.

* Foxconn’s MIH EV platform, Dongfeng Motors, and Mitsubishi Electric have already signed on
* IVY enables software-driven revenue streams for automakers (subscriptions, upgrades, real-time analytics)
* BlackBerry captures recurring revenue from these services

Right now, the market assigns IVY zero value because revenue has not yet scaled.

But automakers are moving toward Tesla-style in-car software features, usage-based pricing, and over-the-air upgrades.

If IVY becomes the data layer that enables this shift, BlackBerry’s valuation moves toward SaaS multiples instead of just embedded software.

And we will know a lot more by next earnings.

# Cybersecurity: No Longer a Drag, Now a Cash Generator

For years, BlackBerry’s cybersecurity business was bloated and uncompetitive.

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M–$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2–4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M–$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8–10x revenue → $2.5B–$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2–4x revenue → $700M–$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced—if it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry’s fair value toward $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it’s not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+.",1463,577,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1irml3j/blackberry_a_legacy_stock_thats_going_to_get/

* Then management sold off Cylance, cut unnecessary costs, and focused on high-trust, high-retention government and enterprise contracts.
* Cybersecurity now generates $350M–$365M annually with a $280M ARR & Margins have improved to 65%
* Trusted by NATO, Fortune 500s, and government agencies

This is not a high-growth business, but it is a stable, profitable enterprise software business that the market is ignoring.

Even at a conservative 2–4x revenue multiple, cybersecurity alone could be worth $700M–$1.2B.

Right now, the market is treating this business as worthless, which makes no sense.

# Market Mispricing: How Big Is the Upside?

BlackBerry is currently trading at \~5x sales, significantly below comparable infrastructure software businesses.

If the market re-rates BlackBerry as a legitimate infrastructure software provider, the stock is an easy double from here.

A reasonable valuation based on its components:

* QNX at 8–10x revenue → $2.5B–$3.5B
* Cybersecurity at 2–4x revenue → $700M–$1.2B
* IVY is completely unpriced—if it scales, it could be worth billions

**This pushes BlackBerry’s fair value toward $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters on the low end, $20+ on the high end if IVY scales.**

If IVY guidance is strong next earnings, that re-rating could start immediately.

# Final Thought: The Market Is About to Wake Up

This is not a meme stock revival.

It is an AI-adjacent, embedded infrastructure software business that has somehow escaped the AI stock rally.

That will not last much longer.

* QNX should not be trading like a no-growth legacy product
* IVY is being assigned zero value, despite real partnerships and revenue potential
* Cybersecurity is now a stable asset, not a liability

This stock is one strong IVY earnings guide away from a re-rating to juicy SAAS multiples. BlackBerry is almost certainly about to be priced like a great software company instead of a clown show. When that happens, it’s not trading anywhere near $5.69 anymore.

I’ve put together the above analysis of BlackBerry. I work on these memos for my own personal investments and want to start sharing them. Thought you degens might like them.

I'm going to be posting diligence on reddit regularly, but only on r/wallstreetbets for positions in my personal book. Follow me on directly if you want to read more.

**TLDR:** My analysis indicates BlackBerry is a high-margin software business that the market doesn't believe could operate a coffee cart at an airport. Their IOT businesses includes the dominant OS for automotive software and an emerging SaaS platform co-developed with AWS both of which should command high multiples. The stock trades at a massive discount to comparable AI-adjacent infrastructure software businesses. In a base case, the stock should trade at $12–$18 in the next 2–3 quarters and if IOT guidance is strong next earnings it can pop to 20+.",1463,577,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1irml3j/blackberry_a_legacy_stock_thats_going_to_get/

Intangible factors like these are part of why I believe companies like Tesla trade at such higher multiples than companies like Google and Microsoft, where people like Elon can divert investors' attention away from fundamentals to distant visions of multi-industry dominance. 
That being said, I've compiled a few stocks that along with fundamentals have leadership that I believe can buoy future growth, such as OKLO, HIMS, and NVDA. Do you guys have any more suggestions prioritizing this factor?

1iq3s4q,1739633423.0,How Musk is using TSLA as a piggy bank,"Everyone knows it is a meme stock. By definition it would crash at some point. The trick is to make money while not ending up being the bag holder when it crashes.

But the stock won’t crash unless Musk starts selling. And he knows it too. So he is using the meme stock and meme coins as collateral to invest in real companies that actually have some realistic valuation. 

Musk sold $8.5 billion in Tesla shares to buy Twitter. The stock went down. He basically converted the meme stock to a real company. The banks underwrote that investment suffered losses but he used Twitter to buy the presidency. The banks lost money but gained favors like less regulations instead. Everyone is happy.

He contracts out TSLA stuff to his private companies like xAi.  XAi and Optimus have huge conflicts of interest. Both of them need the best AI talents. My guess is Optimus will end up being the hardware side of the business(nuts and bolts assembly) while the software and IPs will belong to XAi. And for every robot sold, there will be a license paid to XAi. If the board removes Musk, the licensing fee will go up making TSLA side of the business virtually worthless.

I am pretty sure the big investment banks know these things but they are given investment opportunities in his private businesses in exchange for their silence and their inflated analyst valuations. And they don’t want to shoot themselves in the foot having lent him huge sums of money.

People say Musk won’t let TSLA down because most of his wealth is tied to it. At this point he is milking TSLA for what it is worth. He is borrowing against inflated meme stock prices to buy real companies that are private. He is hedging against the inevitable TSLA crash. His lenders are going with the Ponzi scheme to mitigate the risk to their massive investment. Having borrowed heavily against TSLA shares Musk has no incentive to work for TSLA anymore.

If I have sizable TSLA holdings I would be nervously watching his latest  and totally random OpenAI cash offer of $98 billion or a potential tik tok bid. That means the stock will crater again if he sells stock, he may not care because by now he knows the game is up. Maybe it is triggered by BYD offering free FSD on 20k cars. And this time there might be no coming back. He might offer you first dibs on SpaceX ipo for holding worthless TSLA shares but it sure won’t be cheap.

Disclosure: I don’t have any positions on TSLA at this point.

1ipetzp,1739551461.0,Meta plans major investment into AI-powered humanoid robots,"[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-plans-major-investment-ai-160000083.html)

Meta Platforms Inc., after pushing into augmented reality and artificial intelligence, has identified its next big bet: AI-powered humanoid robots.

The company is making a significant investment into the category — futuristic robots that can act like humans and assist with physical tasks — and is forming a new team within its Reality Labs hardware division to conduct the work, according to people with knowledge of the matter.

Meta plans to work on its own humanoid robot hardware, with an initial focus on household chores. Its bigger ambition is to make the underlying AI, sensors and software for robots that will be manufactured and sold by a range of companies, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced.

Meta has started discussing its plan with robotics companies, including Unitree Robotics and Figure AI Inc. At least initially, it doesn’t plan to build a Meta-branded robot — something that could directly rival Tesla Inc.’s Optimus — but it may consider doing so in the future, the people added.

The humanoid effort mirrors exploratory projects at other technology giants, including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Deepmind division. A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.

Meta confirmed the creation of the new team to employees Friday, telling them it will be led by Marc Whitten, who resigned as chief executive officer of General Motors Co.’s Cruise self-driving car division earlier this month. He was previously an executive at gaming company Unity Software Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.

“The core technologies we’ve already invested in and built across Reality Labs and AI are complementary to developing the advancements needed for robotics,” Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, wrote in a memo reviewed by Bloomberg News. He mentioned the company’s advancements in hand tracking, computing at low bandwidth and always-on sensors.

Meta executives believe that while humanoid robotics companies have made headway in hardware, Meta’s advances in artificial intelligence and data collected from augmented and virtual reality devices could accelerate progress in the nascent industry. Current humanoids are still not useful enough to fold clothes, carry a glass of water, place dishes in a rack for cleaning or conduct other home chores that could get consumers interested in the category.

“We believe that expanding our portfolio to invest in this field will only accrue value to Meta AI and our mixed and augmented reality programs,” Bosworth wrote. Whitten, who will report to Bosworth, will have headcount to hire around 100 engineers this year, one of the people said.

Meta’s goal is to provide what Google’s Android operating system and Qualcomm Inc.’s chips did for the phone industry by building a foundation for the rest of the market.

The software, sensors and computing packages that Meta is already developing for its devices are the same technologies that are needed to power humanoids, according to one of the people involved in the project.

Meta has been investing billions of dollars for years into its Reality Labs hardware division, which sells products like the Quest VR headset and the increasingly popular Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta plans to spend $65 billion this year on related products, including artificial intelligence infrastructure and the new robot work.",113,86,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ipetzp/meta_plans_major_investment_into_aipowered/

1iojaoh,1739454143.0,Apple’s Stock-Market Performance Is Increasingly Made in China,"* Country is both a significant market and key production hub
* Apple has underperformed other Big Tech stocks this year

>Investors in America’s biggest company are increasingly focused on China, where Apple Inc. is striving to win over a crucial customer base while also facing tariff-related risks.

>The iPhone maker counts China as a significant market and a major manufacturing hub. If it improves its flagging sales in the country with artificial intelligence features in its devices, that could be a key catalyst to revive the investment case. On the other hand, tariffs and the prospect of an escalating trade war represent risks of unknown magnitude.

>Read: Apple’s China Focus Thrusts It Into Center of Geopolitical Fight

>“Apple’s level of exposure to China is a risk relative to much of the rest of the market,” said Matt Stucky, chief equity portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. The prospect of Apple being in the crosshairs of tariffs or investigations should be on investors’ radars, he said.

>“However, if AI iPhones are a success, that could mean steady growth over the next several years,” he added.

>The shares are down 5.4% in 2025, making Apple the worst performer among the Magnificent 7 except for Tesla Inc. Sentiment has soured in recent months, with tepid demand for the iPhone 16 — the first to incorporate AI features — and tariff risks weighing. The company’s recent results were mixed, featuring disappointing China and iPhone sales, though the forecast was seen as encouraging.

>Improving China sales would be significant. Apple got about 17% of its fiscal 2024 revenue from the greater China region, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, compared with about 26% for Europe and more than 40% for the Americas.

>The potential for improved trends in China was demonstrated this week, when Apple jumped on a broadly negative day for markets following a report that it has started working with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to bring AI features to Apple products in China. The Chinese firm’s chairman confirmed the partnership on Thursday.

>“We would view this as a critical catalyst for Apple’s competitive standing in China,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote earlier this week. Citing a survey the firm conducted, he added that Chinese iPhone users are more interested in AI than US or European peers, and that more than 50% said the staggered roll out of Apple Intelligence had “a moderate to significant impact on their decision not to upgrade to a new iPhone this cycle.”

>Any improvement would also come after a period of muted growth compared with Big Tech peers. Apple’s revenue has fallen in five of the past nine quarters, and while analysts expect 4.9% growth in fiscal 2025, this is less than half the 11.6% pace expected for the overall tech sector, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

>Within this context, geopolitical tensions loom large. The Trump administration imposed 10% tariffs against China, and the country retaliated with tariffs of its own. China is also weighing a potential probe into Apple’s policies and App Store fees.

>Analysts are so far downplaying the risk of tariffs, though they note uncertainties like how long they might be in place and whether Apple will get an exemption. Evercore ISI sees an impact “in the range of 3-4% of EPS,” which it described as “relatively minimal.” Bank of America said the impact on earnings should be “limited” and “manageable.”

>Still, Apple’s valuation suggests limited room for error. Shares trade at 31 times estimated earnings, roughly 50% above their average over the past decade. The stock also trades at a premium to the broader market and the overall tech sector.

>Following multiple downgrades this year, just over 60% of analysts recommend buying the stock, a rate well below megacaps like Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., or Meta Platforms Inc.

>Still, investors continue to view Apple as a relatively defensive stock given its strong cash flow, massive buyback program, high-margin services business, and a lack of heavy spending on AI.

>“Apple looks a little problematic in the short term given the valuation and the lack of growth, but you’re not going to find a more impressive cash-cow of a company,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services. “There’s a reason it remains an institutional and retail favorite.”

1io2cwt,1739395868.0,$INTC The most hated 10 bagger that will make grandma proud,"TLDR; only truly American fab. With AI race at full speed, semiconductor hardware (NOT SOFTWARE) will become the defining strategic resource of the superpowers. 


People will say oh but TSMC is better at production, but NVDA designs better chips, but AMD. We have to take a trip through the history of TSMC and its founder Morris Chang as well as the cold war. 

Let's look at Morris. He went to Harvard and MIT and then stayed in the US to work for Texas Instruments for 30 years, obtaining his American citizenship in the process. 30 years is more time than many in this app have lived thus far. I'd say he's an American through and through. He was next in line for the position of CEO at TI, but ultimately because he was of Chinese descent he was turned down for the role. Now, at the age of 55, the Taiwanese government reached out to him to fund a fab company; TSMC is born. 

AI will be more important than the space race and the nuclear arms race. The implications are so profound that nations are no longer cooperating to build it together and are strategically trying to limit the advancement of their enemies; e.g. blocking Nividia chip sales to China. The most effective embargo is a hardware embargo. 

With national security at stake, if they didn't trust Morris to run TI, what would make them trust TSMC to be the sole provider of chips to America? And on a side note, with TSMC in Taiwan and the vast majority of chips being produced in a country neighboring China, that risk level is over 9000. China is already designing and producing their own  chips with varying degrees of success. You guys can fill in the blank of what the US government fears the most. It is absolutely crucial to have production back in the US. 

That leaves us with the only option, Intel. It is the only company that has a full white lineage of leadership. Real American Company as some would say.

I'd say he's an American through and through. He was next in line for the position of CEO at TI, but ultimately because he was of Chinese descent he was turned down for the role. Now, at the age of 55, the Taiwanese government reached out to him to fund a fab company; TSMC is born. 

AI will be more important than the space race and the nuclear arms race. The implications are so profound that nations are no longer cooperating to build it together and are strategically trying to limit the advancement of their enemies; e.g. blocking Nividia chip sales to China. The most effective embargo is a hardware embargo. 

With national security at stake, if they didn't trust Morris to run TI, what would make them trust TSMC to be the sole provider of chips to America? And on a side note, with TSMC in Taiwan and the vast majority of chips being produced in a country neighboring China, that risk level is over 9000. China is already designing and producing their own  chips with varying degrees of success. You guys can fill in the blank of what the US government fears the most. It is absolutely crucial to have production back in the US. 

That leaves us with the only option, Intel. It is the only company that has a full white lineage of leadership. Real American Company as some would say.

Something to note - BYD doesn't sell cars in the US so Trump's tariffs has 0 impact on them. They also have the best selling electric cars in China and are growing their market in Europe + Latin America. And as the world sours on America, American products (including cars), and Tesla - they can even gain from Trump's decrees. It has gone up by 25% since Trump came into office.

1inuyqj,1739377864.0,Why is Tesla Share Price so Expensive?,"If Tesla doesn't own xAi or even SpaceX, Elon own this company why is it Valued at a Trillion Dollar?

Even when Tesla is selling just 6 models of Vehicles. As of February 2025, Tesla offers the following vehicle models:

1. Model S: A full-size luxury sedan known for its high performance and long range. 


2. Model 3: A mid-size sedan designed to be more affordable while maintaining performance and range.


3. Model X: A mid-size luxury SUV featuring falcon-wing doors and seating configurations for up to seven passengers.


4. Model Y: A mid-size crossover SUV available in five- and seven-passenger configurations. A redesigned version, known as the ""Juniper"" Model Y, was introduced in early 2025, featuring updated exterior and interior designs. 


5. Cybertruck: A full-sized electric pickup truck with a distinctive stainless steel exoskeleton design. Deliveries began in late 2023.


6. Semi: A Class 8 semi-truck designed for cargo transport, with initial deliveries starting in December 2022. 

Yes, Tesla will have RoboTaxis and it will be Revolutionary but Waymo is already here and working and so Alphabet should get a Trillion Dollar more for that:-


Market Capitalization:
Alphabet: Alphabet's market cap is around two Trillion dollar.
Tesla: Tesla's market cap is reported to be between one Trillion Dollar. 

Also, Elon Musk has been an Over-promise 
and unreliable of what Vision he is selling to there Shareholders that Tesla is worth a Trillion dollare. 

Tesla has several subsidiaries that contribute to its business in electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage, and other technologies. Some key Tesla subsidiaries include:

1. SolarCity Corporation – Acquired by Tesla in 2016, SolarCity focuses on solar energy products, including solar panels, solar roofs, and energy storage solutions.


2. Tesla Energy Operations, Inc. – Handles Tesla’s solar and energy storage business, including Powerwall, Powerpack, and Megapack.


3. Tesla Motors Netherlands B.V. – A European subsidiary managing Tesla's operations in the Netherlands and other parts of Europe.


4. Tesla Shanghai Co., Ltd. – Operates Tesla’s Gigafactory in China, producing vehicles like the Model 3 and Model Y for the Asian market.


5. Tesla India Motors and Energy Pvt. Ltd. – A subsidiary established in India, primarily for future operations in the country.


6. Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. – Provides auto insurance services tailored for Tesla vehicle owners.


7. Tesla Finance LLC – Offers financing and leasing options for Tesla customers.


8. Tesla Automation GmbH – A German subsidiary specializing in manufacturing automation and robotics, previously known as Grohmann Engineering.


9. Maxwell Technologies, Inc. – Acquired in 2019, Maxwell Technologies focused on ultracapacitors and battery technology improvements.


10. Tesla Ltd. (UK) – Manages Tesla’s operations in the United Kingdom.



These subsidiaries help Tesla expand its presence in EV production, energy solutions, insurance, and automation.

No Space X or Ai Company that the Company should be worth so much is owned by Tesla. Just because it's Elon Musk so Tesla should be worth so much!? Don't forget he is dangling between D.O.G.E. and X and fighting with OpenAi over nothing. How do people see him as a visionary now when he is just a Marketer, enjoying Memes and got a Department to Run. Yes, this Department could indirectly help his Tesla. (Wink wink*) but a Trillion Dollar Company over just Promises. That just hard to Digest.

1inb7p0,1739312413.0,TSLA isn't the NVIDIA of EV's anymore,"

I’m no Tesla expert, and I’m sure plenty of people know way more about the company than I do, but I wanted to throw out some thoughts and see what you all think.



Right now, TSLA is sitting around $330 a share, up 75% YOY. But honestly, I see some major red flags:



📉 Shrinking Profit Margins – Tesla’s margins have been steadily declining for years. Not a great trend.



🏴‍☠️ Musk’s PR Nightmare – Elon literally gave a “Sieg Heil” on live TV. Now, a huge chunk of the world sees him (and by extension, Tesla) as a Nazi. That’s… not exactly great for brand reputation.



🚗 Cybertruck is a Mess – Poor build quality, tons of issues, and at this point, it’s basically a meme.



🌍 New Political & Tariff Risks – Tesla is vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, an anti-EV U.S. President, and a California governor who hates Musk and might pull state EV rebates.



⚡ Serious Competition is Catching Up – Tesla isn’t the undisputed EV/FSD leader anymore. Other companies are matching—or surpassing—them in innovation.



🚦 FSD is Overhyped – Despite all the robotaxi talk, Tesla’s self-driving tech is still only Level 2-3. Meanwhile, other companies already have Level 4 robotaxis on the road.



🔋 Rising Costs = Profit Squeeze – Raw material costs are going up, and Trump’s tariffs on China-made batteries could make things even worse.



🤖 Tesla is Struggling to Attract Top AI Talent – Even before Musk’s latest antics, nearly all top AI researchers and recent ML PhD graduates from the top schools were choosing OpenAI, Anthropic, or GAMMA (Google, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Apple) over Tesla or xAI. Now? Even fewer want to work there, which could hurt Tesla’s AI progress.



🔵 Losing Left-Leaning Consumers – Left-leaning buyers are way more likely to buy EVs than right-leaning ones. And almost every left-leaning consumer has grown to despise Musk, leading them to choose non-Tesla EVs instead.



Tesla used to be the Nvidia of EVs—they were miles ahead of everyone else. But that’s just not the case anymore. There are more non-Tesla EV options every year, and in terms of FSD, several companies already have a better product and better talent. So, to me, a $1.1 trillion valuation feels ridiculous.



What do you guys think? Am I being too bearish, or is Tesla in for some rough times ahead?",3340,609,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1inb7p0/tsla_isnt_the_nvidia_of_evs_anymore/

1in7t76,1739304027.0,Is the media missing the story on Tesla ?,"Yesterday, Trump has escalated a trade war with steel and aluminum tariffs.  He's threatening more tariffs on Canada and Mexico and Europe.  China got a broad 10 percent tariff last week on top of existing tariffs.

I just read a Motley Fool post on why Tesla (TSLA) is down today.   Motley Fool is usually a good summarizer of news about what's moving a stock.  It mentions BYD's new driver assist, steel and aluminum tariffs from Trump, that Musk is working on DOGE, and that he's feuding with Sam Altman about OpenAI.  It doesn't mention retaliatory tariffs, a government action.  It doesn't mention boycotts, a consumer action.  It doesn't mention that people are tweeting that there is a Tesla boycott happening in Europe and that across a swath of countries sales are down about 47.7 percent. I can't post the tweet because I can't post an image here.  I skimmed the summary of Cramer's recent comments on how tariffs can affect the auto industry and there was nothing there on a boycott. A Quartz article blames BYD. Are the media missing the real story?

I've also heard reports of Teslas being vandalized, with anti-Musk slogans carved into them.

Moreover, last quarter was seen by the market as disappointing, if not delusional, adding a financial component to the concerns. This could be a reason to adopt a bearish outlook on the stock.

1in2fl3,1739290914.0,ELI5: what is risk to hold TSLQ for several months?,"Edit:  thanks for replies.  I think I understand better now, the concept of ""decay"" (due to volatility, rebalancing etc) and how an inverse ETF can go down even when the stock it's tracking also goes down.

New question:  let's say I'm willing to make a ""bet"" that TSLA goes down in the next 6-12mo... what is the simplest way for me to make that bet?  Do I really have to get into margin accts and short selling?  Basically I'd like to ""mirror"" TSLA for next 12mo.  Is there a simple way to do that or not really?

\---

I'm new to inverse ETFs and have a small position in TSLQ.  I do know that several 'warnings' say that these style investments are meant for intraday, but since it is an ETF I don't understand the risk of holding for weeks or months.  (apart from the obvious, if the tracking stock goes up)  So here's my question, if the hypothesis comes true (that TSLA goes down over next 6mo) what is the risk to just hold TSLQ ETF for that period?

Another way to ask, is there something else going on with the 'tracking' where over longer periods of time the ETF won't track to certain kinds of losses (eg; during after hours or something else...)?  Is it possible that TSLA goes down over a period of time but somehow TSLQ doesn't gain?

Sorry if this is remedial or breaks any rules please let me know... I'm genuinely confused after reading different things about inverse ETF risks.",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1in2fl3/eli5_what_is_risk_to_hold_tslq_for_several_months/

1ilf3sk,1739109012.0,I want to invest in $UBER - help,"
Been researching Uber as a potential investment and wanted to share my thoughts about the risks and upside to make sure im not missing anything.

Uber’s current valuation seems disconnected from its fundamentals. It trades at a P/E of ~16x 2025 earnings, lower than DoorDash (~40x) and the broader market. Free cash flow jumped to $6.9B in 2024, and analysts expect $7.7B in 2025, i think the stock hasn’t fully priced this in. There’s also optionality in hidden assets like its stakes in Waymo and Fairfax India’s Bangalore Airport, which could unlock billions if those companies go public.  

Management has been aggressive with buybacks ($7B program) and debt reduction, cutting net debt/EBITDA to 1.2x. They’re reinvesting in growth areas like autonomous vehicles (partnering with Waymo and Tesla) and Uber One subscriptions, which already drive 35% of gross bookings. Advertising revenue is a sleeper hit—it grew 80% last year and could hit a $5B annual run rate by 2026.  

Near-term catalysts include a $1.5B accelerated buyback and possible S&P 500 inclusion. Long-term, AV adoption could add $12B EBITDA by 2030. 

Risks? AV delays or regulatory hurdles, but at 1.2x P/B and $9B cash (~10% of market cap), downside feels capped. Upside to $115+ seems plausible if execution continues.  

What am I missing? Are AV partnerships overhyped, or is Uber positioning itself as the aggregator?  How sustainable is the advertising growth with competition from DoorDash/Lyft? Does the cash cushion and buyback program make this a safer play in a shaky macro?  

Would love to hear others’ takes.

1ik6czd,1738964033.0,Optimus Prime is the Theranos of Robotics.,"Let’s talk about Tesla’s so-called humanoid robot, Optimus Prime. No, not the heroic Autobot—we’re talking about the overhyped, perpetually “just a few years away” prototype that Elon Musk keeps parading around at AI Day events.

Every few months, we get a heavily edited clip of Optimus shuffling around, carefully avoiding any task that requires real dexterity, decision-making, or autonomy. And yet, Musk keeps selling the dream: A fully functional humanoid worker that will revolutionize manufacturing, households, and even the economy itself.

Let’s be real. Optimus isn’t even remotely close to being “prime time.” The entire humanoid robot fantasy hinges on breakthroughs that Tesla simply hasn’t demonstrated. Actuators, balance, AI-driven adaptability—these aren’t trivial problems, and companies far more specialized in robotics (Boston Dynamics, Agility Robotics, etc.) have been working on them for decades.

But Tesla’s playbook is classic Musk:
	1.	Announce something ambitious.
	2.	Show a prototype that barely functions.
	3.	Promise revolutionary breakthroughs in an unrealistic timeline.
	4.	Let the hype machine and stock price do the heavy lifting.

It’s giving Theranos vibes—promising a sci-fi future that current technology simply can’t deliver. The difference? Elizabeth Holmes didn’t have fanboys willing to defend her vaporware at all costs.

Meanwhile, Tesla’s factories don’t even use Optimus internally (wouldn’t you start there if this thing was viable?). Instead, we get another carefully choreographed video where the bot picks up a box, maybe folds a shirt, and walks like it just woke up from anesthesia.

Until Optimus can move, grasp, and react as well as a $25/hour human worker (and at a cost that makes economic sense), it’s just another Muskian pipe dream.",241,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ik6czd/optimus_prime_is_the_theranos_of_robotics/
1ik4nfq,1738959679.0,Chinese Markets are Rejecting Tesla,"Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is slipping, and nowhere is that more obvious than in China. According to a new report from CNBC, Tesla’s sales in China dropped 11.5% this January compared to the same time last year. With China setting the pace for the global EV industry, Tesla is rapidly losing ground to local giants like BYD.

It’s not just a sales dip, it’s a wipeout. In January, BYD sold 30% more EVs than Tesla worldwide. The reason? Cost and variety.

While Tesla leans on price cuts to compete, Chinese brands like BYD are already priced lower from the start. Tesla’s profit margins, once its strong suit, are shrinking fast, while BYD keeps scaling production without sacrificing profitability. The Model 3 and Model Y Tesla’s core models are struggling to hold their own against a flood of cheaper, high-tech, government-backed alternatives.

For years, Tesla thrived under China’s policies that welcomed foreign EV makers. That era is over. The Chinese government has made it clear, they want their own brands to lead the global EV race. Companies like BYD, Nio, and XPeng are now the priority, while Tesla is increasingly seen as an outsider.

Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory, once a strategic advantage, is now a vulnerability. The Chinese government could tighten regulations, cut subsidies, or tilt the playing field even further in favor of domestic competitors, any of which would weaken Tesla’s foothold even more.

Elon’s strategy of constant price cuts has helped sustain demand, but the latest 11.5% sales drop suggests the approach is losing its effectiveness. Cutting prices again and again doesn’t build brand loyalty.. It signals that demand is slipping.

And Tesla can’t keep squeezing its margins forever. The competition isn’t slowing down it’s accelerating.",3342,374,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ik4nfq/chinese_markets_are_rejecting_tesla/

It looks like it is going to be a rough quarter for Tesla and it is quite obvious that the P/E ratio is quite crazy. But, let's be honest, value investing is long outdated, so trying to be bearish at this point with these meme stocks is absurd.

And still I ask myself if it is possible to make money of this situation... And I was thinking. These fuckers are holding a big amount of ""alternative"" cash in their balance sheet, which does not looks like to be a healthy strategy for a serious company, is not possible to take advantage of it?

I mean, I don't know exactly which ""alternative"" cash ;) are they holding and I am too lazy to do the research, but many of these are quite iliquid and, consequently, quite easy to manipulate.

What impedes somebody with enough financial muscle of making a few big transactions at the end of March, so the Mark to market of these show a big loss when revaluated? Wouldn't be enough to, combined with the lower revenue and the huge overvalued share price, tu push the stock over the cliff?

Indees, cannot a few people coordinate this and take a few puts on the share? Indeed, Tesla cannot sell the ""alternative"" currency without realizing a big loss due to the illiquidity of it and the panic effect could imply. Unless they are holding everything in the most well known ""alternative currency"", and even this one can be manipulated, they would push too much the price down.

1ik062b,1738948558.0,Tesla car sales in China fall 11.5% as competition intensifies,"Sales of Tesla’s cars to China fell in January, as competition from domestic rivals continued to heat up.

Tesla sold 63,238 units of its electric cars in January, down 11.5% from the 71,447 cars sold in the same month last year.

Shares of Tesla were down about 1.5% in premarket trading.

Chinese rival BYD meanwhile sold 296,446 pure electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles last month, up 47% year-on-year.

Other Chinese rivals of Tesla, including Changan Automobile and Xpeng, also posted growth in sales.

Tesla has attempted to use price cuts as an incentive to retain Chinese’ buyers interest in its car. Late last year, Tesla slashed the price of its Model Y car and also extended a zero-interest five-year loan plan until the end of January.

Last month, the U.S. giant also announced a revamped version of the Model Y — one of its best-selling EV autos — in China. This also came with a 0% interest plan.

Tesla has not introduced a new model since it began delivering the Cybertruck in late 2023, which starts at nearly $80,000. Investors have been yearning for a new mass-market model from the company to reinvigorate sales.

Tesla has said a new affordable model could be launched in the first half of 2025.

Meanwhile, the automaker is pushing to launch its driver assist system, which it markets as “Full Self Driving,” in China this year, as rivals also roll out similar features.

1ij89u7,1738863398.0,Tesla gears up for Optimus production with hiring push at Fremont factory,"Tesla is taking a big step toward bringing its humanoid robot, Optimus , to life. The company has officially begun hiring for various manufacturing roles at its Fremont Factory in California, signaling that it is preparing for large-scale production of the AI-powered robot.

According to recent job postings on Tesla’s careers page, the company is looking to build a specialized team dedicated to Optimus production. The company is hiring for a variety of roles, including: (h/t: Sawyer Merritt)

* Manufacturing Engineering Technician, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Quality Technician, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Process Technician, Tesla Bot
* Production Manager, Tesla Bot
* Process Supervisor, Tesla Bot
* Associate Production Manager, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Controls Development Engineer, Tesla Bot
* Production Supervisor, Tesla Bot
* Process Associate Manager, Tesla Bot
* Process Engineer, Tesla Bot
* Manufacturing Equipment Engineer, Tesla Bot
* Quality Engineer, Tesla Bot

Karissa Thein, a Senior Sourcer at Tesla, confirmed the hiring push in a recent post on LinkedIn, saying:

“My team is turning Tesla Bot into a reality! We’re building Tesla Bot in our Fremont Factory in California, and we’re looking for engineers up for the challenge of getting this product ramped up for high-volume production.” 

Tesla unveiled the first working prototype of Optimus in 2022, demonstrating its ability to walk, manipulate objects, and perform basic tasks. The company unveiled the most recent prototype, Gen 2, in late 2023, which has significant advancements in its movements and capabilities compared to previous prototypes. The long-term goal is for the humanoid robot to take on repetitive or dangerous jobs, both in Tesla’s own factories and in other industries.

During the company’s Q4 2024 earnings call, Musk said the V1 production line would be able to produce roughly 1,000 units per month. Musk further explained that he expects that line to launch in mid-2026, and the first deliveries of Optimus to companies outside of Tesla will take place in the second half of 2026.

Musk has previously stated that Optimus could be Tesla’s most important product in the future, even surpassing the company’s vehicle business in scale with the potential to generate $10 trillion in revenue. With Tesla now actively recruiting engineers and production specialists, it appears that the transition from prototype to practical deployment is well underway.

News: [Us Initial Jobless Claims Pick Up But Stay Relatively Low](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-06/us-initial-jobless-claims-pick-up-but-stay-relatively-low)

**Ticker:** [**F (Ford Motor Company)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Ford Motor Company reports .39 vs .34 expected, revenue of $48.2 vs 43.6B expected. Announces that profit could fall by $2B or more due to tariffs and lower EV demand.

**Technicals:** Pretty much broke the $10 level it's been trading around since August, watching to see if it'll sell off more by the open. Highly/infinitely liquid.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The entire automotive industry is challenged by tariffs. F guided lower for 2025.

**Risks:** Obviously these are one of the bigger movers from Mexico tariffs (most cars are assembled in Mexico then shipped to the US).

**Related Tickers:** GM, TSLA, STLA.

**Offhand Comments:** Ford's outlook reflects the broader industry's apprehension about geopolitical factors affecting operations and profitability. Interesting to see how other car companies react to earnings as well.

**Ticker:** [**ARM (Arm Holdings)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)

**Catalyst:** ARM reported EPS of $0.39 vs. $0.34 expected. Revenue of $983 million vs. $959M expected. Buoyed by Deepseek ban news, most likely as well.

**Technicals:** Was down roughly 8% after earnings, but seems to be somewhat recovering after Deepseek news.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** Semiconductor sector is experiencing heightened demand, especially after PLTR's comments that the AI train will never stop. We're seeing growth in data center applications, the main driver of semis purchases.

**Risks:** Despite strong performance, Arm's lowered full-year revenue forecast has led to a 6% drop in its shares.

**Related Tickers:** NVDA, AMD, INTC.

**Ticker:** [**RBLX (Roblox Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RBLX&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Roblox Corporation reported earnings with an EPS of -$0.33 vs. -$0.46 expected. Revenue of $988.2M vs. $967.2M expected.

**Technicals:** $50 is the clear level here, note that earnings were released premarket rather than aftermarket yesterday. Seems to be a massive overreaction selloff (but has recovered somewhat).

**Risks:** IIRC Roblox isn't profitable yet- they're focusing on growth/revenue over profits, but most of their costs are outside their control (platform fees like the Apple store, developers, infrastructure for trust/safety for minors).

**Related Tickers:** EA, TTWO.

**Ticker:** [**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has temporarily suspended its API service top-ups due to server resource constraints. Additionally, U.S. lawmakers plan to introduce a bill to ban DeepSeek's chatbot application from government-owned devices over data security concerns.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** The AI industry is under increased scrutiny regarding data security and geopolitical tensions but that's grown more laissez-faire under Trump. DeepSeek's service suspension and potential U.S. government ban helps American chip makers and NVDA especially, due to their continued dominance.

**Risks:** Deepseek getting banned will likely lead to greater reliance on American AI chatbots, spurring growth in American semis manufacturers.

**Related Tickers:** AMD, INTC, QCOM.

**Offhand Comments:** (I am currently long).

**Ticker:** [**SWKS (Skyworks Solutions)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SWKS&p=d)

**Catalyst:** EPS of $1.60 vs. $1.57 expected. Revenue of $1.07B vs 1.07B expected. Reports $2B stock buyback plan.

**Technicals:** Watching the $60 level, we've had a brutal fall from $90->$60. If we get closer I'm interested in some small bounce depending on volume/size of the move.

**Catalyst/Sector Context:** SWKS supplies some of the chips for Apple's iPhone, and their iPhone sales haven't done too well recently- thus this has a knock-on effect by affecting SWKS's sales.

**Risks:** SWKS projected a revenue decline for the mobile segment and issued a lower profit forecast. They stated they anticipated a ""mid-to-high teens decline in mobile.""

1iixryb,1738829897.0,Is Microsoft too big to be affected by a Trade War?,"There are currently talks of US tariffs on the EU, and the EU retaliating against Big Tech in particular. My question is, would it even be possible to go after Microsoft? It seems to me like they provide essential services to pretty much every country. Whereas with someone like Tesla, you could easily hit them hard, hitting Microsoft would only hit the EU too, so I’m wondering if a trade war would even be a problem for us MSFT holders?",144,160,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iixryb/is_microsoft_too_big_to_be_affected_by_a_trade_war/
1ih835v,1738638592.0,Tesla’s Valuation: Speculation or Real Growth? My DCF Insights,"I did a quick and dirty DCF valuation for TSLA, and here’s what I found. I don’t own TSLA individually; I only have exposure through the S&P. However, with recent events, I’ve been wondering why people hold TSLA.

My typical process when looking into a company starts with a DCF to gauge approximately what the company should currently be valued at. I know, I know, it’s not perfect, but it’s a way to get started.

For TSLA, I averaged the last three years of free cash flow (FCF) at about $5.1 billion. I used a 5% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth rate of 3%, along with a discount rate of 12%. All these estimates are generous for a few reasons: the share count is increasing, FCF has declined over the past three years, and the risk is high.

With these assumptions, I came up with a value of $26.24, which is only 6.85% of the current price. This means that 93% of the value is based on future growth and speculation.

Now, many people assume that Tesla will revolutionize humanoid robots and self-driving cars, so I took a more optimistic approach to the DCF. I used a 20% FCF growth rate and a terminal growth of 7%, which is probably unrealistic. Using the same discount rate, I arrived at a value of $52.62. This represents 13.74% of the current value, meaning 86.26% is based on even more future growth and potential.

With all that said, it’s hard for me to understand what people see in this company. Or am I just thinking the wrong way, and it has nothing to do with making money?

Congrats to all the long-term holders who have made a killing! I’d love to hear your thoughts on this.",13,85,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ih835v/teslas_valuation_speculation_or_real_growth_my/
1ifna8h,1738464090.0,Canada will retaliate with 25% tariffs on US imports and limit export of rare minerals as response to Trump tariffs! Trade war is on!,"Canada is imposing it’s own 25 per cent tariffs on $155 billion worth of U.S. goods after U.S. President Donald Trump slapped Canada with 25 per cent tariffs on all goods and 10 per cent tariffs on oil, natural gas and electricity.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says the tariffs will take effect on $30 billion worth of goods starting Tuesday with a further $125 billion worth of products being taxed 21 days later.

Trudeau elected to go ahead with retaliatory tariffs even though Trump’s order includes a mechanism to escalate the rates if Canada retaliates against the U.S.

Canada will also look at how to limit export of rare minerals to the US which are crucial for US tech and car companies like Tesla.

You could Throw in Cisco which has a monopoly over and controls about 66% of the cell phone networking hardware industry in American and it will still be roughly the same. By the way many of the companies on this long list have profit margins and growths that over the last year blow Tesla out of the water. Tesla is not outpacing other companies, other companies are actually catching up to them in the ways they have been growing.

Also, keep in mind that Musk just pissed off about 50 million democrats who were Tesla's existing core customer base. Multiple people at my work who own Tesla's have said they are now embarrassed to own a Tesla.

The speculation is partly based on Tesla's currently nonexistent and delayed automated taxi company. Let's put how weak Tesla's position in perspective.

Tesla plans to open an automated taxi company in Austin Texas this summer. 1 city.  Waymo (owned by Google) started in it's first city 8 years ago and is planning on expanding from 3 cities (San Fransisco, LA, and Pheonix) to 12 over the next year. Tesla is almost a decade behind in this industry and are not in a good position to dominate it or reach fully non city dependent fully automated driving in any way. There is also absolutely no indication that their business model is in a better position than their competitors in this industry currently.

For this current Market cap to be realized, Tesla would essentially need to come to control the majority of 3 major industries while Musk is sitting around playing video games for 12 hours a day (according to him) and playing politician in the Trump administration.",862,288,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1iemmrp/psa_teslas_market_cap_is_now_higher_than_the_top/

**Thoughts:** We will literally see a decision from Trump tonight regarding whether or not oil will be exempted from the tariffs, otherwise the stocks I'm watching on the OVERNIGHT exchange are F/GM/TM and TSLA/LCID (stands to lose rather than gain if oil is exempted) in addition to all the oil stocks that are standard (OIL, BP, XOM, etc). We might also see some volatility tomorrow at the open, VIX has already spiked but went back to preannouncement levels.

~~EDIT: TARIFFS ARE DELAYED UNTIL MARCH 1ST~~

# [EDIT 2: ANNOUNCEMENT OF TARIFF DELAY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED, STILL CONTINUING ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO WH PRESS SECRETARY ](https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/north-america-braces-new-trump-tariffs-saturday-deadline-nears-2025-01-31/)

>President Donald Trump President Donald Trump said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

>“We’ll be announcing the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for a number of reasons,” Trump told reporters Thursday in the Oval Office as he signed executive actions in response to a deadly airplane collision.

>“Number one is the people that have poured into our country so horribly and so much. Number two are the drugs, fentanyl and everything else that have come into the country. Number three are the massive subsidies that we’re giving to Canada and to Mexico in the form of deficits,” he said.

>West Texas Intermediate oil futures climbed above $73 a barrel following the comments. The US dollar wiped out an earlier loss to touch the day’s high after the remarks, while the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso both plunged. US Treasuries pared their gains.

>Trump indicated the 25% rate could represent a floor, saying that the tariff levels “may or may not rise with time.”

>But the US president did suggest he was still considering if one significant import — oil — would be exempted. Trump said would be making a determination as soon as Thursday evening, basing his decision upon the price of oil.

>“We don’t need the products that they have. We have all the oil that you need. We have all the trees you need,” Trump added, referring to major imports from Canada.

>Trump’s move was closely anticipated by markets as well as global business and political leaders who have scrutinized his words and actions for any indication on whether the US president would deliver on his levy threats or use them as the starting point for negotiations on trade.

>Trump in recent days threatened and then pulled back on tariffs against Colombia in a dispute over deportations of undocumented migrants, leading some to speculate that he was using trade levies merely as leverage to seek policy concessions.

>Trump also indicated that he would proceed with tariffs on China. He didn’t specify the levy, though he’s previously said it would be 10%. Trump has said Beijing failed to follow through on promises to prevent fentanyl and the chemicals used to make the deadly drugs from flowing into the US.

>“With China, I’m also thinking about something because they’re sending fentanyl into our country, and because of that, they’re causing us hundreds of thousands of deaths,” Trump said Thursday. “So China is going to end up paying a tariff also for that, and we’re in the process of doing that.”

>Trump has ordered his administration to investigate whether China complied with a trade deal struck during his first term, setting the stage for tariffs against the world’s second largest economy.

>Following through on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, who are US neighbors, major trading partners, and export markets, threatens to have dramatic economic consequences, rattle markets and potentially launch a trade war by undermining protections from a three-nation free trade agreement.

>Both countries have pledged to respond to any trade levies, including with retaliatory tariffs, even as their leaders sought to assure the US they were addressing border concerns in a bid to defuse the conflict.

>“If these tariffs go into effect, Canada will respond,” Canadian Ambassador to the US Kirsten Hillman said Thursday. “This is not something that we want to do. We do not want to get into a tariff-back-and-forth with the United States. It’s not good for Canada, Canadians and Canadian workers and it’s not good for the United States, Americans and American workers.”

>Hillman said that Canada has responded to Trump’s concerns about the border by clamping down and announcing new security measures, including added drones and helicopters.

>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort even before the president was inaugurated in a bid to ease tensions between their nations, and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke to Trump to try to avert the levies.

>In the first 11 months of 2024, US trade with Canada totaled $699 billion and $776 billion with Mexico. And the magnitude of tariffs Trump will enact could have stark impacts on particular industries, such as the auto industry and the energy sector. Shares of US automakers Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. turned negative on the announcement, erasing earlier gains.

>“President Trump’s tariffs will tax America first,” Matthew Holmes, executive vice president at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday. “From higher costs at the pumps, grocery stores and online checkout, tariffs cascade through the economy and end up hurting consumers and businesses on both sides of the border. This is a lose-lose.”

>Trump is also promising sectoral tariffs, such as on pharmaceuticals, semiconductor chips, steel, aluminum and copper, which could apply widely to many countries, including Canada and Mexico.

>The US president is an avowed believer in tariffs, saying they will force a renaissance in domestic manufacturing, though industry groups warn that it will upend supply chains and endanger existing factories by raising costs of source materials.

>He’s hailed tariffs as a source of revenue as lawmakers move to renew and expand expiring tax cuts and approve other credits and benefits the president promised on the campaign trail. Trump wants to reduce the corporate rate to 15% for firms that manufacture goods in the US, compared to the current 21% rate.said he would follow through on his threat to impose 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1, citing the flow of fentanyl and large trade deficits as among the reasons for his decision.

The potential of the stock moving today is what makes it interesting, everything else is secondary.

**Today OpenAI may make history. Trying out longer form, more detailed catalyst examinations over the short-form with more tickers.**

**Ticker:** [**META (Meta Inc)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=META&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $8.02 vs $6.68 expected. Revenue of $48.4B vs $47B,but guided revenue short of consensus and didn't provide FY25 revenue outlook (which triggered the reason for the selloff post-earnings after the close).

Their CAPEX announcement was $60-65B vs $52.4B expected, and stated they expected the single largest driver of expesive growth in 2025 as infrastructure costs due to higher OpEX and depreciation.

Also announced plans to grow META's AI team significantly.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Earnings move the stock on far less volume but the initial selloff after announcement was worth trading- interested in the $700 level today but not much beyond that.

**Context:** Decent earnings but signals that there is more spending on the horizon- likely that the initial brutal selloff to $606 was from algos just reading the initial eye-popping CAPEX number and selling the company.

**Sector Context:**There is a major next-level breakthrough that OpenAI is expected to release today that has agents performing on the same level as PHDs, Altman is meeting today with US government officials. META is the creator of Llama, which is another open source model compared to OpenAI's closed models.

**Risks:** Deepseek has been the main threat involved, with competitors from China using distillation and other AI techniques to be able to train a far cheaper model that brings up the question of why our large tech firms are spending so much on GPUs. (I'm sure this is news to you /s)

**Related Tickers:** FAANG stocks, SNAP, PINS, etc.

Offhand:  Something worth remembering is that there is a $10B undersea cable that spans over 40K km that they plan to build (unknown what the cable is for), more details coming in 2025. Likely some kind of fiber optic cable.

**Ticker:** [**TSLA (Tesla Inc.)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** Reported earnings of $0.73 vs $0.76 expected. Revenue of $25.71B vs $27.23B expected. Most of this revenue miss came from miss in sale of EVs. 

TSLA announced interesting plans to lower the price of EVs in 2025 but also didn't give specific details regarding the production volume targets (as they have in the past), and also announced that there would be a paid robotaxi service in Austin in June. This puts them in competition with Waymo/UBER. Personally I think the vision-only approach is not viable in the long-run but hey, I'm no self-driving PHD. 

CAPEX was ALSO higher as with META due to spending increases from AI training infra costs and battery production capacity.

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** I'm mainly interested in the $375/$400 level, not too interested in going long despite the multi-day slide in price.

**Context:** Main reason for TSLA's selloff was the lack of full-year guidance (it gives the subtext that it's too bad to release publically or it's up in the air). Political statements made by Musk may contribute to future issues for TSLA.

**Sector Context:** Revenue shortfall was caused due to lower-than-expected vehicle deliveries/ increased sale incentives, 496K cars vs 507K exp. China's BYD is rapidly catching up, and the (possible) removal of the US EV tax credit may make EV's more expensive

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical- if the tariffs on EV vehicles imported to the US gets removed, TSLA will face fiercer competition from BYD. Also Elon Musk.

**Related Tickers:** BYD (but mainly trades in China, TSLA isn't as impacted by AI news.)



[**NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) (in addition to ARM/AMD/SMH/SOXL/semiconductor stocks)**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)

**Catalyst:** The reveal of Deepseek has introduced an AI model that rivals existing solutions but was developed at around $6M. However there's a rumor that Deepseek is actually trained on 50K H100 NVDA gpus.

**Yesterday after the close, there was an announcement Trump officials discussing tightening curbs on Nvidia's China sales.**

**Volume/Market Cap/Technicals:** Overall, there's been a massive selloff since NVDA was $150 at the end of last week. Overall interested again if we hit $116, but low confidence we'll sell off again. 

Currently long.

**Sector Context:** Not much to really say about this beyond NVDA having the most advanced chips that are widespread for training because of the CUDA architecture- most people are doubtful that the TOTAL cost was $6M

US Officials are examining export restrictions but China will likely find a way to bypass them as they have previously.

**Risks:** Mainly geopolitical, again. Obviously it's very difficult to restrict trade to a country that we have no military presence in or surround, and China is economically far more powerful than those we have attempted trade restrictions on in the past.

*****
> S&P 500 futures rose Thursday as Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Investors are coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve held steady on rates.
*****
> Futures tied to the broad market index added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.5%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were fractionally lower.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla gained 1% and 2%, respectively, while Microsoft shares dipped more than 4% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company’s quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. On the other hand, revenue misses from UPS and Caterpillar weighed the indexes down.
*****
> Other “Magnificent Seven” names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple’s results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week.
*****
> On Wednesday, all three major averages ended the session lower as a 4% decline in Nvidia weighed on the market. The declines came after the Fed paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains “somewhat elevated.”
*****
> “The implication is that we’re on hold until the inflation rate goes down, and unfortunately it’s probably not going to go down very much in the several months ahead, so I wouldn’t be looking for rate cuts at the next meeting,” Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine Capital CEO, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell.”
*****
> “We have a relatively stable place where we’re standing, and it kind of supports the fact that the market is in a calm position right now, and so is [Jerome] Powell apparently,” he said.
*****
> On the economic data front, the fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading is due on Thursday, and weekly jobless claims are out in the morning. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index report for December.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors await Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/28/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> Stock futures were near the flatline on Wednesday as investors turned toward the first Federal Reserve interest rate decision of 2025.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched down 13 points. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.3% higher, while S&P 500 futures was trading around the flatline.
*****
> Tech stocks on Tuesday led the S&P 500 higher and brought the Nasdaq Composite to a 2% gain. The two indexes made a comeback after incurring sharp losses on Monday in a sell-off spurred by the emergence of China’s DeepSeek and the threat it poses to the artificial intelligence trade. Nvidia, which suffered a roughly 17% decline Monday, jumped nearly 9% on Tuesday.
*****
> “As far as the DeepSeek news over the weekend, at the end of the day today, there really hasn’t been that much of an impact on a market-wide basis,” Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
> The Fed’s interest rate decision on Wednesday is now a focal point for investors, as well as Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference. Fed funds futures data reflect a nearly 100% certainty that the central bank will keep rates steady at a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, according to CME Group data.
*****
> “When it comes to the Fed, they’re widely not expected to do anything tomorrow and that’s a good thing. The less the Fed has to do, the better it is for the market, in our view,” Hickey added.
*****
> Investors will be paying especially close attention to Powell’s comments — his first press conference in President Donald Trump’s second term. The two have had a contentious relationship dating back to Trump’s first term. The president has already said he would “demand that interest rates drop immediately.”
*****
> A volley of Big Tech earnings are due Wednesday afternoon, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla issuing their quarterly reports.

1ickhww,1738120917.0,Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones,"**Thoughts:** Obviously good for companies that are involved in the sat comm business (but may be bad/neutral for sat comm companies that do not work with AAPL such as GSAT), TMUS, and AAPL. TSLA is also possibly affected because SpaceX trades as a proxy to TSLA news. VZ/T/other phone providers may be affected but the use case is so niche that I won't hold my breath. 

>Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company’s in-house satellite-communication service.

>

>The companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone’s latest software update — released Monday — now supports the technology.

>

>The tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.

>

>T-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test.

>

>The first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, “You’re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.” Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.

>

>An Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will “begin with select optimized smartphones” and that the full launch will “support the vast majority of modern smartphones.” T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

>

>Ever since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there’s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple’s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has “had some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.”

>

>Here’s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to enable texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.

>

>The initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple’s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.

>

>There’s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically — even when the phone is in a customer’s pocket.

>

>Both the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don’t have cellular service. The capabilities can’t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.

>

>T-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple’s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn’t disclose the Starlink support.

>

>SpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile’s cellular network in November.

I am pretty confident that a match or slight beat/ miss will cause the stock to correct. I am therefore thinking of taking my modest profit now and selling out of the stock completely. Notwithstanding my feelings on Musk's personal actions.

Recently disclosed text messages reveal that Elon Musk tried to sway Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund—commonly known as the Oil Fund—to support his controversial Tesla pay package. The fund, which manages assets of around USD 1.8 trillion and holds a significant stake in Tesla, voted against Musk’s compensation proposal, prompting him to admonish CEO Nicolai Tangen not to request any “favors” until making amends.

In their exchange, Musk also accused Tangen of leaking the texts to the media, after Norwegian outlets reported on his canceled dinner appearance at the Oil Fund’s investment conference. Tangen countered that Norway’s strict transparency laws, akin to the U.S. Freedom of Information Act, required partial disclosure, including confirmation that Musk would not attend.

Initially, the Oil Fund classified much of the conversation as private and withheld it. However, in the spirit of transparency, they eventually released all texts. The incident highlights the tension between Musk’s calls for discretion and the Norwegian Oil Fund’s legal obligations to remain open. While emphasizing a positive relationship with Tesla as a critical investment, the fund has reiterated its opposition to Musk’s pay plan.",3381,188,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ic2lgt/elon_musk_tried_to_pressure_norways_wealth_funda/

# [S&P 500 futures are flat as Nvidia attempts to rebound from AI stock rout: Live updates](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/27/stock-market-today-live-updates.html)

*****
> S&P 500 futures were relatively unchanged early Tuesday, following a sell-off fueled by worries over the emergence of Chinese startup DeepSeek and its greater implications for the artificial intelligence trade.
*****
> Futures tied to the S&P 500, along with Nasdaq 100 futures, traded just above the flatline, rising 0.1%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were also flat.
*****
> Futures were trading in step with Nvidia in the premarket, with both trading off their highs during the session. Nvidia added around 2% after suffering a nearly 17% decline on Monday, which resulted in a market cap loss of nearly $600 billion — the biggest one-day drop for a U.S. company in history. Broadcom and Oracle also traded higher by more than 2% and around 1%, respectively.
*****
> Concerns over DeepSeek came to a head on Monday, with the Nasdaq Composite losing more than 3%, while the S&P 500 slid about 1.5%. The Chinese startup last month unveiled a free open-source large language model that it says took less than $6 million to build. The development spurred worries around Big Tech’s investment into AI. DeepSeek surpassed rival OpenAI on Monday to become the most-downloaded free app in the U.S. on Apple’s App Store.
*****
> “Valuations remain extended, and while vulnerabilities were expected this year, developments like DeepSeek highlight the need for diversification beyond the Mag Seven,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. “The 2025 theme of US exceptionalism is now facing uncertainty, with ongoing concerns around tariffs and inflation adding to market challenges.”
*****
> Investors’ attention is turning toward corporate earnings due this week. Starbucks is due to report Tuesday after the bell. A slate of Magnificent Seven companies will report in the coming days, with Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Tesla and Apple due later this week.
*****
> The Federal Reserve will also kick off its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday. Fed funds futures are pricing in a more than 99% chance that interest rates will remain unchanged, according to CMEGroup’s FedWatch Tool. Inflation data out Friday will give investors further insight on the health of the U.S. economy.

1ib78ft,1737979573.0,The Case for TSLA: the Business Value,"Many people consider TSLA to be overvalued based on fundamentals. Make no mistake - it absolutely is... based on fundamentals.

The value of TSLA, beyond the Twitter-political volatility, comes from its proven track record in achieving the impossible.

**Breaking Into an Otherwise Unbreakable Car Market**

How many new Western car companies can you recall successfully breaking into the market in the last few decades?

The only real answer is TSLA.

Everything else is bleeding money, a penny stock, or a YouTube car review channel side quest.

**Popularizing an Otherwise Undesirable and Impossible Product**

Before the EV boom, any consideration of a successful EV business would be immediately countered with legitimate concerns.

The car community wouldn't be very excited without their loud 4L V8 engines.

The product would be impossible to make as the batteries would be expensive, heavy, unreliable, and yield a low driving range. If you did get an EV, you wouldn't be able to charge it since there were no charger networks.

Not to mention the expected environmental returns from selling EVs, but generally disrupting the market and directing it towards sustainable energy cars. I love my fuel-hungry loud 6-cylinder German beast, but ICE engines in the mainstream have an expiration date and will eventually become a niche when the larger market transitions to EVs. TSLA takes the credit for this - singlehandedly. Everybody else follows.

**Scaling Up: Actually Selling Cars**

Tesla is [still leading](https://www.automotivedive.com/news/electric-vehicle-sales-us-2024-increase-cox-automotive/737528/) EV sales, and is in the [top 10](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/06/top-10-best-selling-cars-in-the-us-in-2023.html) of all car sales. Meanwhile, VW is closing down their factories in Germany.

**Advertisement by Word of Mouth**

You see Ford Focus 1.0 EcoBoost billboard ads everywhere in Europe, and RAM / JEEP / Chevy Silverado / F-150 / Hyundai / Kia ads everywhere in the US.

TSLA built itself on word of mouth and a vision for the future, which is a testament to its value for customers.

**Elon's Proven Track Record in Business**

[Winning](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/science/spacex-moon-nasa.html) NASA award contracts in competition with Blue Origin and other space companies, [catching](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp66ye6ep63o) skyscraper sized objects landing, and a Roadster [roaming](https://www.astronomy.com/science/astronomers-just-deleted-an-asteroid-because-it-turned-out-to-be-elon-musks-tesla-roadster/) through space are just a few of the business and technological achievements of Elon Musk (not to mention the side quests). With someone so unreasonably effective at building things that work, investors project that TSLA is a safe and promising bet.

How many reusable rockets has anybody else caught landing recently?

**Criticisms**

No product or company is without criticisms. From the bad build quality, to the still-unfulfilled FSD promises, to the lack of Cybertrucks in Europe, to the removal of the turn signal stalks; and most recently, the political criticisms.

**Consequential Actions, Not Ideologies, Drive the World**

The bottom line for a business is creating products and services that people love, and there are *zero* indicators that TSLA, as a business, is going anywhere. It thrives *despite* all criticism (of which I do think most is reasonable) and lack of marketing, which is a testament to the value they provide.

**Market Temper Tantrums Are a Feature, Not a Bug**

Look beyond the ephemeral temper tantrum-driven volatility of the market.

Last year, in March, GOOG dipped from 160 to 135 when Gemini generated some questionable images; today it's close to ATH at >200.

Last year, in August, CRWD dipped from 380 to 220 when they pushed out a buggy update. (How dare they, a software company, pushing a buggy update?!) Today, it's trading close to ATH again.

Today, the market finally noticed DeepSeek and is going through yet another mental breakdown.

It is like a palm tree: it will bend but it won't break.

Learn to put your prejudices aside and buy companies that execute well - not companies with a nice little PR team that will sweet talk you.

**But Is It Overpriced?**

By traditional fundamentals analysis - of course it is. But we've already established there's nothing traditional about TSLA as a company, so your little P/E ratio calculations won't work. They have failed consistently.

Look at the execution of TSLA and compare it to its Western competitors - they aren't even in the same league.",0,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ib78ft/the_case_for_tsla_the_business_value/
1i9q788,1737821270.0,Deere - has run out of room to run.,"The great American company is trading at a all time high but is facing a lot of headwinds in 2025.

1 Tarriffs - Deere made the mistake of outsourcing their production outside the US and will pay the price with the new administration. They recently announced they were moving production to Mexico for some of the equipment manufacturing which lead to a boycott by farmers and a threat of 200% tariff if they do, which wont happen because you cant really impose this (tariff)tax on a specific company. But this was a mistake by the company because now they spent all this money to setup the factories and production in Mexico but cant really use it as intended.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-john-deere-will-be-hit-with-200-tariffs-if-production-moves-mexico-2024-09-23/)

They also made the mistake of outsourcing tractor production to India. A good amount of production is outside the US, meaning tractors are assembled in India, Europe and elsewhere and sent to the US for sale. Which is a problem because these are not cheap tractors/equipment and someone is going to pay the tariff on foreign goods entering the United States. Not that easy to readjust the whole supply chain back to the US and having to pay people alot more money. Average worker in India makes $5k per year ,in the US these manufacturing jobs will cost maybe $50k-$80k+ per year. Profit margins just got smaller.

[https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-john-deere-exports-made-in-india-tractors-to-us-europe-3000473/](https://www.financialexpress.com/business/express-mobility-john-deere-exports-made-in-india-tractors-to-us-europe-3000473/)

Then there is the US manufacturing exports. Deere Exports alot of their products to other countries, not all customers are in the US. If we impose tariffs on lets say German cars coming into the US, they will 100% in retaliation impose tariffs on US cars, heavy equipment and farm equipment being sent into Europe, South America, China, Etc.  Deere isnt the only manufacturer of tractors and farm equipment, you have a lot of manufacturers around the world. People are just going to buy cheaper domestic products.

2 Rumored Pick up truck - There's been a rumor going around they are planning to launch a pick up truck. I think this would be a costly mistake and they just wouldn't be able to compete with the best selling pickup in the world the F-150. Car manufacturing is very expensive as Elon has stressed multiple times, ramping up production costs ALOT of money, and might not be worth the effort, especially if it flops. There is just too much competition is the space between Toyota, Ford, General Motors, Tesla, Rivian, Nissan, Dodge.

3 FTC sues Deere for Farmers right to repair - The complaint -This unfair steering practice has boosted Deere’s multi-billion-dollar profits on agricultural equipment and parts, growing its repair parts business while burdening farmers with higher repair costs, the FTC’s complaint alleges.

i dont think this FTC suit is going away, the current administration will 100% stand behind the hard working farmers that feed America. 62% of revenue comes from Agriculture Equipment and 13% comes from financial services. Farmers are using Deere Financing to repair Deere equipment, Its 100% a monopoly.

Between decreasing revenue/sales, higher labor cost, higher production costs and increased competition this company has quite a few challenges to work through this year.
